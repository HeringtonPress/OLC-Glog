#### 1. A Rope Is Always Handy
R: Touch D: [dice] hours

You tie a rope around your waist and make it act as a third, mind-controlled yet semi-sentient, fully capable hand. The rope can wield a light weapon and make an extra attack in combat.

#### 2. Absolute Reality

D: [dice] rounds

The Ultrareality comes crashing into mere reality like a wave into a sand castle. Think a word. Any word. Everything real within your line of sight must save or be that thing, in addition to what they are. If that thing contradicts what they are, it consumes and replaces it.

#### 3. Against Prying Eyes

#### 5. All Things Adjacent

D: [dice] rounds

You are adjacent to all things within your line of sight. You can punch anything you could see. You can pick up any object and put it in your pocket as if it were beside you. However, you are affected as if you were in every location at once. (To put it in grid-based combat terms, you are affected by all effects effecting every observable square. You do not suffer multiple effects from the same hazard).

Obviously, casting this spell within sight of the sun is instantly fatal.

#### 6. Alter Gravity

R: 60’ D: [sum] rounds

You must cast this spell in an enclosed area with a solid roof of maximum [dice] x 30 feet cube. The target area has its gravity altered to either a direction or a lower strength that you specify for the duration. The effect takes place gradually, allowing creatures a save to hang on to something. In lower gravity, you can jump higher and farther, but virtually any action requires a DEX check. If you invest 4 or more [dice] the duration becomes permanent.
