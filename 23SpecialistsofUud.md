## The Senex

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: a walking stick and a piece of practical-but-unique headwear.

**Starting Skill**: Folklore and your choice of History, Poetry, Philology, Mysticism, Monstrumology, Alchemy, Mythology, Runes & Glyphs, or Geopolitics.

**A:** Well-Learned, Ancient Tongues

**B:** Unanswered Questions

**C:** Deep Insight

**D:** Hidden Speech

### Tricks
  
Every time you gain a Sennex template, roll 1d12 and gain that Trick. If you roll a repeat, take your choice of the one above or below it.
	
Tricks take up a Psyche slot but the material components of them always seem to be on hand without taking up an inventory slot.

### A: Well-Learned

For each Sennex template you posses you may have a skill not take up a Psyche slot.

### A: Ancient Tongues

When you encounter some bit of language that you don’t know—like a page in a book, inscription on a ring, or occult chanted phrase—there’s a 2-in-6 chance you know it. Not that you know the whole language, just that you happen to know what this particular bit of language means. 

As you gain templates in this class, the chances that you know any particular bit of language increases by 1-in-6 per template.

### B: Unanswered Questions
  
You have a stat called Unanswered, which starts at 0. Everytime you encounter something very strange and mysterious and unknown in your adventuring, add 1 to your Unanswered stat. Note that this has to be stuff that is really weird and unexplained, not minor stuff. 

Good examples of unanswered questions include:

  1. What is through the Red Iron Door under Mount Breakspear?
  2. Who is the hooded figure we keep seeing at dusk and dawn?
  3. Why would our friend, the Duke of Ravenwood, suddenly turn on us?
  4. What happened that caused the ruined castle to the east to split in half?
  5. Where can we find the lair of the demonghast called Fatemonger?
  6. What does this mysterious serrated amulet do, and how do you use it?

Big, bad questions, ones with reaching implications and strange answers. Again, whenever you have a new question, write it down, and then add 1 to your Unanswered stat.

When you are in the presence of a great deal of knowledge—which might be a big library, another sage or scholar, some ancient wise being, or something else entirely—roll 1d6. If the result is less than or equal to your Unanswered stat, you learn the answer to one of your big questions, and then reduce your Unanswered stat by the amount rolled. This can be related to the source of knowledge you’re dealing with, or it could just be a flash of inspiration; how you piece the info together matters less than that you now know it.

It’s important to note that if you discover an answer to one of your big questions organically, just through playing the game, that doesn’t reduce your Unanswered stat. You only reduce your Unanswered stat when you specifically use your Senex ability to divine answers in this way.

### C: Deep Insight

If you spend a minute or so watching someone, you can make 3 Swords checks. For each success you learn one of the following three things; what their next immediate course of action is, why they’re taking that particular course of action, and how you could best change their mind. Once you’ve done this, you can’t do it again until tomorrow, and you can’t do it to the same person two days in a row.

An example of this could be “the King is going to banish us from the realm,” and “he’s doing it because he’s already unpopular with his subjects, and news of war from the South would spark further unrest,” and “he fears for his own throne, but if we can protect his throne he’ll be happy to keep us around.”

### D: Hidden Speech
  
When you succeed on the now 4-in-6 roll to use Ancient Tongues, you now have enough of that language to carry on a medium-length conversation fluently. 

Furthermore, you can now use Ancient Tongues (and thus Hidden Speech) on things that might not ordinarily qualify as languages: the call of wild animals, the whispering of trees, the crash of a thunderstorm, the clink of gold coins, the creak of an old castle, or the cry of the oppressed. 

### Tricks
For each Senex template you take, you roll 1d12 and gain one of these; if you roll a repeat, take your choice of the option above or below it.

  1. **Flask**. You always have a small flask of alcohol on you, no matter what, and when you or a party member really need a slug, it’s always got just enough.
  2. **Voice**. You are very good at doing imitations and mimicry, to an uncanny degree.
  3. **Animal**. You’ve got a small animal with you, like a raven or a cat, that is cleverer than normal, can read whatever you can, and will sometimes do what you tell it to do.
  4. **Quill**. You’ve got a quill (or a knife, if you’d rather be etching than writing) that can write on anything—wood, stone, metal, whatever. 
  5. **Light**. You can touch a small object to make it glow like a candle; you get 1 hour of this per template per day.
  6. **Notebook**. You have a notebook on your person that never leaves your side. Literally. If someone takes it away from you, it’ll end up back on your person, somehow.
  7. **Cowl**. When you wear your practical headgear, you can choose to have it hide your face from all but dedicated scrutiny; you’ll just look like an old person, and people will quickly write you off.
  8. **Tea**. You’re just really bonkers good at making tea, and know tons about it; if you claim it’s magical, anyone and everyone will believe you.
  9. **Fire**. You can start a small fire with almost anything under almost any conditions. 
  10. **Staff**. Your walking stick will never break, and you have advantage on checks against being deprived of it (which includes stuff like Háma at the door to the Golden Hall).
  11. **Charm**. People just seem to take a shine to you when they first meet you, especially animals, children, and elders.
  12. **Mouth**. You can whistle clearly and loudly, blow ornate smoke-shapes, and tie knots with your tongue.

## The Dwarf

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>

**Starting Equipment**: A Chainmail, a rough iron Shield, and your choice of an Axe, a Hammer, or a Pike.

**Starting Skills**: Your craft (roll on the 1D200 Failed Medieval Careers) and your choice of Hill Life, Undermountain Guard or Banker.
	
**A:** Smell Treasure, Rowdy Heart

**B:** Greed, Obsession

**C:** Heart of the Delver

**D:** Stubborn

For every Dwarf template you have, you gain an extra Inventory slot.
	
### Smell Treasure

You can smell gold, jewels, gems, silver–minerals and crystals of value. If you stand at a crossroads and sniff, the referee will tell you which direction has the most treasure. If you sniff in an empty room, the referee will tell you if you smell the faint odor of potentially buried treasure.

### Rowdy Heart

If you drink a full bottle of alcohol, you can roll FORT. On a success, cure one poison, diseases or potion affecting you.

### Greed

Gain a +1 HP for each inventory slot filled with Valuables or Treasures.

### Obsession

You don’t even need sleep when you work: your obsession is refreshing. Each rest, as long as you have basic tools you can either …

- Make significant repairs to a single object overnight.
- Refill one stack of mundane amunition.
- Craft a small object no bigger than your hand.

When you do the Craft carousing activity, the item you create is a step more valuable than the investment you put in it.

### Heart of the Delver

Always knows when all the secret doors and passages on a floor have been discovered. You can sense the general direction of exits and stairs to other levels.

### Stubborn

You get so stubborn even spells stop affecting you. Magic of any kind, both good and bad, cannot work on you. Shaving your beard cancels this ability.

## Homunculator

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: dagger, 4 flasks, and 4 syringes.
**Starting Skills**: Your choice of Medicine, 

**A:** Homunculus, Gift of Flesh (Choose from 1-10 or roll 1d10)

**B:** Gift of Flesh (roll 1d20), Curse of Flesh (roll 1d20)

**C:** Shared Senses, Regeneration

**D:** Gift of Flesh (Choose 1-20), Curse of Flesh (roll 1d20)

### A: Homunculus

You have an obedient servant. You made it from a newborn bear. It is, in a way, your child. It is as intelligent as a well-trained dog.

A default Homonculus has 5 in all stats, 10 HP, and is the size of a person. They make 1 melee attack per round that deals 1d6 damage. Gifts and Curses of Flesh can alter these stats. They do not need to test Morale. A Homonculus is a hireling that thinks you're a mother-god.

Non-magic damage cannot kill a Homunculus. Making cancer obedient is easy when it knows nothing but obedience from birth. Vital organs are not required when any cell can perform any function. Any damage beyond 0 (negative HP) instead incapacitates a Homunculus for that many hours. Acid, fire, magic, or being spread over a square mile will kill a Homunculus permanently. Creating a new one takes 3 weeks, and a treasure in components, and access to an area where bears are likely to be found.

Homunculi still need to eat (and heal as a normal PC), sleep, and breathe. They are not proficient with weapons, have no inventory slots (but can temporarily carry up to 10 slots of items if carefully supervised), and will try to remove clothes and armour.

Injecting the vital extracts (blood or spinal fluid are traditional) of a creature into a homunculus grants it temporary powers, typically for 1 hour. Roll on a [Monster Menu-All table](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIV4ttS3R1JWWNBa0VZalA2SGc/view?resourcekey=0-6ahNldQ9avxA6DwF4UkDhg), bearing in mind that negative effects only last 1 hour. Injecting 2 or more things (or injecting something very powerful) requires the Homunculus to Save or become torpid for 1d6 hours. On a critical failure, it dies instead. You can take 1d12 damage to let the Homunculus reroll a failed Save.

### B: Shared Senses

You can share senses with your Homunculus. This ability has a 500' range.

### C: Regeneration

Instead of healing like a PC, a Homunculus heals 1 HP every 30 minutes. If you are touching your Homunculus, you can transfer 1 HP from it to you per round.

 Gifts of Flesh

### 1d20 	Gifts of Flesh
1 	Corded Muscles. Strength becomes 7. Deals +2 melee damage. Can climb at running speed.
2 	Serpentine Grace. Dexterity becomes 7. Moves at double speed. If you fail a Save, the Homonculus can take full damage to push you out of the way.

5 	Twitchy. Wisdom becomes 14. Has a 50% chance to act in surprise rounds.
6 	Charisma. Charisma becomes 14. Save becomes 6. For 1 hour per day, can shift to resemble a human. An obvious and unnerving fake close-up, but not easy to detect from a distance or in a crowd.
7 	Collapsible. Can shrink to the size of a dog. Slightly bulbous and windy when fully inflated.
8 	Aquatic. Can breathe underwater. Swim at running speed.

16 	Rubberized. Immune to fall damage. Reduces incoming bludgeoning damage by 2.

20 	Hypersensitive. 30' darkvision. Can detect strong magic at 60'. May detect secret doors or traps.
	
### 1d20 	Curses of Flesh
1 	Timid. In dangerous or novel situations, the  Homunculus must test Morale to leave your sight for more than a few minutes.
2 	Fragile. If the Homunculus takes 3 or more damage in a round, it must Save or spend the next round writhing in agony.
3 	Wrong Scent. Animals fear the Homunculus. Small creatures flee, dogs bark, horses shy, and larger creatures target the Homunculus with furious hostility.
4 	Territorial. If ordered to attack, the Homunculus must test Morale to attack anything but the largest and most dangerous target. Does not appreciate close contact with your friends or allies.
5 	Easily Bored. If inactive, will knock things over, swat people, or make alarming noises.
6 	Auorovore. Every time the party obtains treasure worth more than 10gp, at least 5% of the total (or 25% of your share, whichever is easiest) must be given to the Homunculus to hoard and devour.
7 	Treacherous. During non-adventuring times (at night, in town, etc.), the Homunculus sneaks off to commit crimes, devour livestock, or terrorize travelers.
8 	Truly Hideous. If visible, minimum of a -4 penalty to reaction rolls. Other hirelings have a -2 penalty to Morale. Face not even a mother-god could love.
9 	Lazy. Unless threatened (by you or by an enemy), the Homunculus takes 1 round to start to do anything urgent, or 10 minutes to start to do anything non-urgent.
10 	Umbilicus. You are connected to your Homunculus by a 20' flesh cord. You can sever it, but while separated your and your Homunculus' maximum HP is reduced by 4. You must reattach the cord to sleep.
11 	Molting. Once per week, the Homunculus must spend 6 hours shedding and regrowing its skin in a truly disgusting and noisy process. It consumes 3 rations immediately after molting.
12 	Superstitious. The Homunculus must test Morale or cower when a holy symbol is visible.
13 	Carnivorous. The Homunculus must eat fresh raw meat as rations.
14 	Slime Trail. Leaves behind a slightly sticky trail of mucus.
15 	Light-Fearing. The Homunculus has a -4 penalty to Attack and Save in bright sunlight.
16 	Full Reformation. If reduced below 0 HP or killed, covers a 30' radius in acidic sludge, dealing 1d6 acid damage per round to anything in the area. Effect lasts until the Homunculus reforms.
17 	Fire-Fear. Must test Morale to remain within 30' of a torch-sized fire or larger. Lanterns, matches, and candles are eyed with distrust.
18 	Growing Distrust. The Homunculus knows what it is and knows it is being used. It may disobey suicidal commands, plot to replace you, or try to gain power on its own.
19 	Disease-Bearing. Automatically fails all Saves against disease. Does not suffer any negative effects from diseases, but is contagious.
20 	Tumorous. Any attack that deals 2 or more damage to the Homonculus knocks off disgusting lumps of flesh, blood, and ichor. No mechanical effect but it's extremely gross.

**D:** Takedown, Never Give Up

### You're a Dog
	
You can't hold things in your paws. You can't climb ropes or ladders. You move faster then the average human. Your bite attack counts as either a dagger, sword, or greatsword (your choice, each bite). You do not start with any items. You can follow (most) scents, and recognize scents you've encountered before.
	
### A: Best Friend

Pick a best friend. You both get +1 Resistance and +1 Save when fighting beside each other. This designation is permanent (until story/DM say otherwise).  If your Best Friend dies, you can pick a new one after playing 1 full session as a sad, sad dog.

### A: Wag

When you wag your tail, you cast a version of charm person that only works on children.

### B: Sniff the Air

10 in-game minutes before the DM rolls for wandering monsters, he also rolls for wandering scents.  The DM rolls on the wandering monster table and describes what one of the monsters smells like.  If you've encountered that type of monster before, you can identify it.

### B: Fight as One

If you and your Best Friend attack the same enemy simultaneously the enemy takes an additional 1d6 damage.

### C: Growl
	
An enemy who can hear you must Save vs Fear or be unable to attack or approach you until your next turn. Doesn't work if you are running away, restrained, or non-threatening.  Doesn't work on things with 2 or more HD than you.
	
### C: Scent the Ineffable
	
As detect poison, detect evil, detect magic, or detect undead except you cannot decipher magic items and the range is limited to 1', except for detect undead where the range is 30'.

### D: Takedown

When you bite an opponent no larger than a human, you can make a trip maneuver for free. 

### D: Never Give Up
	
If your Best Friend is ever at 0 HP, you can lick their face to restore 1d6 HP.  If your Best Friend is ever paralyzed, mind-controlled, raging, or otherwise out of control, you can lick/bite them (whichever is more appropriate) to give them a new save against the effect.  Only works on things that allow saves in the first place.
