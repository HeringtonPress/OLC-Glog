For every level of bleed on you at the start of your turn roll a d4. For every blood die that landed on a 4 reduce the bleeding condition by 1. Take whatever damage is rolled on the blood die.
	
**Blindness**

You can’t see or make ranged attacks. Attacking and Dodging are hard rolls.

**(Not) Breathing**

You can hold your breath for as many rounds as your Fortitude. If you take damage while holding your breath, you must make a Fortitude save. On failure, you start dying.

**Charmed**

You fail all rolls against your charmer. If you attack, hurt, or say anything bad about them, you take 1 mind damage.

**Confused**

Roll a D6. You must spend your turn interacting with: 1) the player on your right; 2) the player on your left; 3) yourself; 4) the closest monster; 5) the environment; 6) oblivion.

**Cursed**

You cannot benefit from magic.

**Dying**

**Grappled**

You cannot move. Roll a D6: 1) your head/mouth/throat is stuck, you can’t breathe; 2) left leg; 3) right leg; 4) left arm; 5) right arm; 6) an item you wear or hold is stuck.

**Invisible**

Attacking and Dodging are easy rolls. You cannot be seen.

**Petrified**

You skip your turn. All rolls are hard. You resist the first 10 damage of each attack.

**Poisoned**

You are disadvantaged in all your actions. Specific poisons can have unique additional effects too.

**Prone**

Attacking and dodging in melee is hard. Dodging ranged attacks is easy. Standing up takes all your turn’s movement.

<details><summary>Rare Metals</summary>
<p>

**Adamantium**

Nothing is more solid than adamantium. Adamantium weapons ignore armor. Adamantium objects are unbreakable and combo with the Fighter’s parry ability.

**Cold Iron**

A fairie that touches cold iron loses all abilities and resistances for a turn. They can smell it.

**Mithral**

Mithral is light like cloth. Attack rolls made with mithral weapons are easy rolls but the damage die is one size smaller. Mithral armor doesn’t impede movement.

**Platinum**

Platinum repairs itself after 10 minutes and as such combos with the Fighter’s parry ability. Platinum weapons ignore the resistances of aberrations as well as their horrid immortality.

**Radium**

Radium sheds light like a candle. It ignores the resistances of celestial creatures like angels and devils. After each adventure spent carrying radium, save or gain a mutation.

**Silver**

Silvered weapons ignore all the resistances of undead creatures and of creatures that are not in their true form.
