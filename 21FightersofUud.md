## Hunter

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: bow, 40 arrows, dagger, leather armour.

**Starting Skill (+5)**: Tracking and your choice of Foraging, Maps, or Beasts. 

**A:** Crippling Shot, Quick Shot 

**B:** Wilderness Sense

**C:** Monster Chef

**D:** Vanish

You can collect enough food in a location with sufficient flora/fauna equal to the number of Hunter templates you have. Food collected this way cannot be presserved and must be consumed the day you collected it.

### A: Crippling Shot

If you hit an enemy with a ranged weapon, you can choose to deal 1 damage instead of rolling for damage. The next attack made by the enemy deals 1⁄2 normal damage.

### A: Quick Shot

If you do not move on your turn you may make an additional attack with a ranged weapon. Your first attack must have been made with the same weapon.

If using a crossbow or other weapon requiring 1 or more rounds to reload, take only one shot, but ignore the reload time.

### B: Wilderness Sense

After the GM gives you the Omen for an encounter, you can choose to reroll the encounter and get a different Omen. You must accept the new result. You have a 50% chance to act in surprise rounds.

### C: Monster Chef

You’ve learned to prepare and preserve monsters that you’ve hunted before (you must keep track of this). Rations created this way provide an additional 1d4 HP.

Make an INT Save to tell if a new monster will be outright poisonous to eat. You can also make an educated guess about the extra effects of consuming magical creatures.

### D: Vanish

If you are in dense forests, hills, caves, or other terrain with abundant line-of-sight-blocking features, you can choose to vanish. While vanished, you cannot affect the world or be affected by it. This ability is limited by plausibility. You can reappear at any time by climbing down a tree, walking over a hill, emerging from a shrub, etc.

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: a heavy weapon of your choice, leather armour, .

**Starting Skill (+5)**: Your choice of Distant Lands, Beasts, Sailor, or Knitting.

**A:** Danger Sense, Tough

**B:** Rage

**C:** Die Hard

**D:** Tough

You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess. HP gained this way does not count towards the 20 HP cap.

### A: Danger Sense

If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act in the surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen before, you can a WIL or appropriate skill check to remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not unique.
 

### B: Rage

You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. You might froth, or stare in battlefocus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.

While in a rage:

- You always act first in combat.
- You gain +1 attack per round.
- All your melee attacks inflict +1 damage.
- You can only cast damaging spells. All your spells deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets).
- You are immune to pain and fear.
- You cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things.
- You cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. If an ally has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.

To stop raging, Make a WIL Check at the start of your turn.

### C: Die Hard

While raging instead of becoming incapacitated when you fall below zero HP you may now still act as normal, only accuring wounds after a number of rounds equal to your Barbarian templates. To stabalize you must first drop your rage which will render you incapacitated as normal.

### D: Tough

Gain +1 Resistance regardless of Armour. Gain +4 to Saves vs. Mind Altering Effects, including your save to end a Rage.

## Knight

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: chainmail, shield, sword, and a common mount.

**Starting Skill (+5)**: Your choice of Courtesy, Poetry, Military or Politics.

**A:** Challenge, Champion

**B:** Bodyguard

**C:** Dragon Slayer, Parry

**D:** Aura of Courage, Inspire

You gain +1 hp and +1 to saves vs fear for each Knight template you possess. 

### B: Challenge

This ability only works on creatures that can understand you and are capable of being offended. If you challenge a creature outside combat, they must Save or accept your challenge. In civilized areas, this could mean a duel, a joust, or a brawl. The challenged party can set conditions for the duel. Leaders may send out champions.

In combat, you can challenge one creature each turn as a free action. The creature must Save. If they fail they must attack you. This ability cannot force an enemy to make major tactical errors.

### A: Champion

After all enemies have completed their turns in a combat round, select one enemy that only targeted you with attacks, and that you targeted with your attack. Make a second attack against that enemy.

### A: Bodyguard

Once per round, if an adjacent ally would take damage from a physical attack, you take the damage instead.

### C: Dragon Slayer

Once per day, you may add +X damage to one of your physical attacks, where X is the HD of the most powerful monster killed by you or your party. Keep track of this.

### D: Imposing Presence

You make your pressence known. In place of Challenge on your turn you may target a hoard of weak enemies forcing them to make a WIL check. Decide wether they react by avoiding you or targeting you specifically.

### Heraldry Generator

| **1d10** | **Field (Base Colour)** | **Division (Overlay)** | **Charge (Decoration)** |
| :--: | :------------------ | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| 1    | Argent (Silver) | Fess (Top/Bottom) | Escutcheon (Shield) |
| 2    | Or (Gold) | Pale (Left/Right) | Lozenge (Diamond) |
| 3    | Azure (Blue) | Bend (Diagonal S) | Roundel (Circle) |
| 4    | Gules (Red) | Bend Sinister (Diag. Z) | Billet (Vert. Rectangle) |
| 5    | Very (Green) | Saltire (Quart. X) | Mullet (Star) |
| 6    | Indigo | Cross (Quart. + | Crescent (Moon) |
| 7    | Vilette (Violet) | Chevron (Half ^) | Cross |
| 8    | Sable (Black) | Pall (Split Y) | Angel |
| 9    | Sanguine (Blood) | Wavy (Half ~) | Lion |
| 10   | Tenne (Tawny) | Dancetty (Half ^^^^^) | Sword |

Roll at least once for Field. If 1 or 2 is rolled, next result must be 3-8. Roll once for Division, designating sections as different Field colours. Roll 1d4 times for Charges, with 1d4 copies of each charge. Muck around with the idea a bit.
