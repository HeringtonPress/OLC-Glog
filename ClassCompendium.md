## Templates & Multiclassing

Each class has 4 Templates. Templates are gained sequentially (A, then B, then C, then D). To multiclass, simply pick the lowest template from another class. E.g. A level 4 character could pick Fighter A, Wizard A, Monk A, and Fighter B. Multiclassing should make sense. Multiclassing for optimization or mechanical reasons should be strongly discouraged by the GM. The game is not about the mechanics or having the biggest numbers. **Bigger numbers will not save you.**

## Fighter

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>

Starting Equipment: leather armour, sword, bow, 20 arrows.

Starting Skill: Roll on the following table.

**A:** Notches, +1 attack per round

**B:** Campaigner, Parry

**C:** Quick Learner, +1 attack per round

**D:** Impress, Cleave

You gain +1 HP for each Fighter template you possess.

### A: Notches

Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below. Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your character sheet.

- +1 Damage
- Expanded critical range (+1)
- Special ability (negotiat with GM, one per weapon).
Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1 damage, a critical range of (1-3), and the ability to stun an opponent for one round on a critical hit. The GM decides what counts as a kill.

### B: Campaigner

Armor occupies 2 fewer item slots in your inventory. Example: chain occupies 0 slots instead of 2.

### B: Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d

### C: Quick Learner

You can become proficient with a new weapon after 4 successful hits (instead of 8). On a critical hit, you immediately become proficient.

### D: Impress

Whenever you win a fight against challenging foes, people who don't like you make a new reaction roll with a +4 bonus. This even works on people you just defeated in combat, unless you caused them undeserved or disproportionate harm. Hirelings get a +2 to Morale or a new Save vs Fear.

### D: Cleave

Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP with an attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a target within 5’. You can only cleave an number of targets equal to your Level in a single round.

### Who Are You?

You are probably a member of the Third Estate. In Civilised Parts, you theoretically owe service to a lord. Carrying a sword is probably illegal, everything you do is taxed, and changing your station in life is almost impossible. If there’s a war on, all the usual rules stop applying. You might be a soldier from a levied army seeking an independent fortune, a mercenary with grand plans, or an unscrupulous highway robber. You’re likely to be practical, worldy-wise, and skeptical.

## Thief

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
Starting Equipment: leather armour, lockpicks, dagger.

Starting Skill: Locksmith and Pickpocket. +2

**A:** Always Prepared, Evaluate, Wall Crawler

**B:** Pick 1 Thief Trick, Roll 1 Thief Trick

**C:** Roll 2 Thief Tricks

**D:** Pick 1 Thief Trick, Roll 1 Thief Trick

You gain +1 to Stealth for each Thief template you possess.

### A: Always Prepared

In town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabelled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Inventory Slots, don’t cost more than you originally paid, and are available in town. You can put multiple items inside a large Unlabelled Package, including smaller Unlabelled Packages. You can have up to two Unlabelled Packages at a time.

### A: Evaluate

You automatically know the worth of mundane items. Unique items may require an Intelligence roll.

### A: Wall Crawler

You can climb as well without climbing gear as most people can with climbing gear. Simple climbs do not require a test. You can attempt impossible climbs.

### Tricks of the Trade

| 1d20 |     | Trick | 
| :--: | :-: | :---- | 
| 1    | Acrobat | You can move an extra 15’ per round (45’ total). You can jump 20’ instead of 10’. Treat your falls as 20’ shorter. You can easily maintain your balance on a taut rope. |
| 2    | Always Armed | Even when you have been disarmed, you still have a dagger hidden on you. |
| 3    | Backstab | Whenever you have a situational bonus to an Attack roll (surprise, elevation, etc.) attacks that hit deal an additional +1d6 damage. |
| 4    | Cat's Eyes | With a small amount of light (moonlight, candle) you can see 30’ in darkness. |
| 5    | Coward | Cover grants you an extra +1 AC. |
| 6    | Dog Whisperer | You start with a dog. Dogs you train can DEX save for stealth with advantage, communicate to you if an area is obviously dangerous, and track a week-old trail by scent without fail (barring magical concealment). |
| 7    | Delicate Tasks | Gain +4 on DEX saves to disable traps and pick locks. |
| 8    | Great Escape | Once per day, you can automatically escape from something that is restraining you and that you could plausibly escape from. This includes grapples, lynchings, pit traps, and awkward social situations, but not sealed coffins. |
| 9    | Lucky | 1/day reroll a D20. |
| 10   | Pack Rat | Gain an additional 3 item slots. |
| 11   | Quick Draw | Gain an additional 3 quick draw slots. |
| 12   | Quick Fingers | You have advantage on DEX saves to pickpocket people. You can steal things directly out of someone’s hands with a regular (no advantage) DEX save. |
| 13   | Recorder Crow | You start with a crow. It can make and play auditory recordings. It responds to Record, Stop Recording, Play, Pause, Rewind, and Fast Forward. Max storage: 1 hour. It’s very smart. |
| 14   | Second Chance | When you trigger a trap you hear a “click”. Save vs INT. Success means you did not trigger the trap and you know exactly what would have happened if you did. |
| 15   | Getaway Horse | You start with a horse. Horses you train can DEX Save for stealth with advantage, understand abstract directions, and follow a schedule to the minute.  |
| 16   | Redirect | Once per round, when an enemy attacks you, you can make a DEX Save to redirect their attack to another creature they can hit.  |
| 17   | Urchin | A street rat demands to learn. They’re a very sneaky hireling that doesn’t ask for pay. If you lose your urchin, you can recruit another wherever urchins are plentiful, but it will be difficult if you have a reputation for getting them killed. |
| 18   | Very Lucky | Requires Lucky. You may use your Lucky ability twice per day. An adjacent ally can use one of your rerolls, provided you could have plausibly assisted them. |
| 19   | Watchful | Gain +4 on rolls to Find Hidden Things. You can’t be snuck past. |
| 20   | Wizardly Initiate | By tasting an object you can determine if it is magical or not. |

### What Did You Do?

You are a member of the Third Estate or an Outlaw. You blend in with society or slide around it, seeking opportunities for wealth and status. You don’t dress like a thief. There are no guilds of thieves. If you are caught you will be maimed, hanged, or worse. Nobody cares who you are; everyone cares about your crimes, or your potential usefulness in their schemes.

## Wizard

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
Starting Equipment: varies by Wizard School. Select a school or roll for one on the adjacent table.

Starting Skill: roll on the appropriate following skills table for the school's status (Chartered, Outsider, or Outlaw).

**A:** Spellcasting, +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +2 Spells (1-6)

**B:** +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +1 Spells (1-8), Book Casting

**C:** +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +1 Spells (1-10), Friendly Spell

**D:** +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +4 Spells (Choice)

### A: Spellcasting

Spells are living creatures. Spells, enchantments, ghosts, and souls are all more or less the same. A wizard's spells range in intelligence from pond scum to ferrets. A spellbook is a menagerie-prison. A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with spell-bullets. Minor spells, called cantrips, infest a wizard's soul and bind to it. It takes 1hr to move any number of spells between a spell slot in your brain and a spellbook, scroll, or wand.

To cast a spell, select a number of Magic Dice (MD) you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a Wizard, you get +1 MD per Wizard template. Most spells depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. Doubles generate Mishaps; triples generate Dooms. Casting a spell from a scroll provides +1 MD as the scroll burns.

Dice that roll 1-3 return to your casting pool and can be used again that day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your casting pool for the day. Your spells return at sunrise to last location they were imprisoned, when the octarine light of the sun touches the world and infuses Creation with an extra boost of raw magic. Your MD return if you get a good night's sleep. If you didn't sleep well, you can Save for each MD to have them return to your pool anyway.

When you gain Template A, roll 2d6s and gain the spells listed. Template B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. Template D, choose 4 spells from the list. If a duplicate spell is rollled, you may choose to keep it or reroll.

You can try to bodge together a spell-like effect appropriate to your school by pouring any number of MD into a target and hoping for the best. Effects are adjudicated by the GM, but are usually haphazard and dangerous. Mishaps and Dooms apply.

You can detect strong ambient magic if you are not distracted. To learn details about spells or magic items, roll under Intelligence.

### B: Book Casting

You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the scroll. This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates. You must declare you are casting a spell from a book before initiatives are rolled for the turn. You automatically go last in the initiative round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the round. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.

### C: Friendly Spell

Apply a random mutation to a spell you frequently cast.

### Who Are You?

You are a member of the Third Estate or an Outlaw. You might be a respectable wizard in recognisable robes, a member of an ancient tradition, radical sect, or curious group of explorers, or you might use forbidden magic to bend the world to your will. You are both useful and a liability.

[Wizard Schools](Chapter06.md#)

### Chartered Wizards

Some schools of magic have royal charters. They are protected by law in many kingdoms. Their pedigree is established, their students (while raucous and troublesome), are predictable, and their utility in war or in peace is undeniable. However grudgingly, they are allowed a place in the order of the world. Chartered schools also charge ruinous tuition, requiring the use of Wizard Student Loans. Graduates of these schools must pay back 10,000gp + 1d1000gp, in monthly instalments of 20gp or more. Magic items, strange spells, and ancient books dragged out of dungeons and tombs are accepted in lieu of gold; that’s the whole point of the Wizard Student Loans.

### Outsider Wizards

Some wizards are neither within the law nor opposed by it. They are strange, ancient schools, forgotten by most, or simply ignored by society at large.

### Outlawed Wizards

Some wizard schools are illegal. Church doctrine and public opinion pursue them with torches, daggers, and the law.

### Who Are You?

## Hunter

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: bow, 40 arrows, dagger, leather armour.

**Starting Skill (+1)**: "Tracking" and your choice of "Foraging", "Maps" or "Beasts". 

**A:** Rangefinder, Wilderness Sense

**B:** Crippling Shot, Quick Shot

**C:** Master Trapper, Monster Chef

**D:** Impossible Shot, Vanish

You gain +1 to Stealth for each Hunter template you possess.

### A: Rangefinder

When you miss with a ranged attack, your next shot is made with advantage.

### A: Wilderness Sense

After the GM gives you the Omen for an encounter, you can choose to reroll the encounter and get a different Omen. You must accept the new result. You have a 50% chance to act in surprise rounds.

### B: Crippling Shot

If you hit an enemy with a ranged weapon, you can choose to deal 1 damage instead of rolling for damage. The next attack made by the enemy deals 1⁄2 normal damage.

### B: Quick Shot

If you do not move on your turn you may make an additional attack with a ranged weapon. Your first attack must have been made with the same weapon.

If using a crossbow or other weapon requiring 1 or more rounds to reload, take only one shot, but ignore the reload time.

### C: Master Trapper

Skilled in the way of hiding traps, any trap you set causes the creature to DEX save with disadvantage. Additionally you can coble together a trap out of things most people would consider mundane and useless.

### C: Monster Chef

You’ve learned to prepare and preserve monsters that you’ve hunted before (you must keep track of this). Rations created this way provide an additional 1d4 HP.

Make an INT Save to tell if a new monster will be outright poisonous to eat. You can also make an educated guess about the extra effects of consuming magical creatures.

### D: Impossible Shot

Once per combat, you can make an impossible shot with a ranged weapon. The attack automatically hits the target, provided it is within 2x the weapon’s listed rage. The attack can bounce around corners, cut a coin in half, or part a single hair on a target’s head.

### D: Vanish

If you are in dense forests, hills, caves, or other terrain with abundant line-of-sight-blocking features, you can choose to vanish. While vanished, you cannot affect the world or be affected by it. This ability is limited by plausibility. You can reappear at any time by climbing down a tree, walking over a hill, emerging from a shrub, etc.

### Who Are You?

You are a member of the Third Estate or an Outlaw. You are a hunter, either of beasts or people. You use ranged weapons (traditionally a bow) with exceptional skill. When danger threatens, you retreat, study, plan, and strike. In this dangerous world your hard-earned skills are valuable.

## Barbarian

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
Starting Equipment: heavy weapon, leather armour.

Starting Skill: Foreign Parts. Also, roll on the following table.

**A:** Rage

**B:** Danger Sense, A Taste of Home, +1 Stealth

**C:** Feat of Strength, Die Hard

**D:** Tough

You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess.

### A: Rage

You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. You might froth, or stare in battlefocus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.

While in a rage:

- You gain +4 to Wisdom for Initiative purposes. You act before all other PCs in a round.
- You gain +1 attack per round.
- All your melee attacks inflict +1 damage.
- You can only cast damaging spells. All your spells deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets).
- You are immune to pain and fear.
- You cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things.
- You cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. If an ally has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.

To stop raging, Make a Wisdom Save at the start of your turn.

### B: Danger Sense

If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act in the surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen before, you can roll under Intelligence to remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not unique.

### B: A Taste of Home

You can consume a special ration to regain 1d6+1 HP. This takes 1 round. Roll on the Table of Barbarian Delicacies. One “dose” costs 1gp and can be purchased in any trading city. 3 doses fit in a single inventory slot. You cannot eat while raging, but you can immediately enter a rage after eating the ration. If you have any Lethal Damage, you instead heal to 0 HP. If an ally waves the ration under you nose, you can roll under Constitution to wake up.

### C: Feat of Strength

Once per day, you have 22 Strength for 1 round. Your Strength bonus is +4.

### C: Die Hard

You have 4 rounds instead of 3 to remove all your Fatal Wounds.

### D: Tough

Reduce all incoming damage by 1 point. Gain +2 to Saves vs. Mind Altering Effects, including your save to end a Rage. 

### Who Are You?

You are from Foreign Parts. The language of people Around Here is strange to you; their customs are sometimes amusing and sometimes disgusting. You might worship the Authority as they do, but you might be from a heretical sect or cult. You are a probably a member of the Third Estate or an Outlaw. You carry your own law and customs.

</p>

## Knight

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: chainmail, shield, sword, horse, 5sp.

**Starting Skill (+1)**: "Courtesy" and your choice of "Poetry", "Military" and "Inquisition".

**A:** Challenge, Champion

**B:** Bodyguard

**C:** Dragon Slayer, Parry

**D:** Aura of Courage, Inspire

You gain +2 to Save vs Fear for each Knight template you possess. 

### A: Challenge

This ability only works on creatures that can understand you and are capable of being offended. If you challenge a creature outside combat, they must Save or accept your challenge. In civilized areas, this could mean a duel, a joust, or a brawl. The challenged party can set conditions for the duel. Leaders may send out champions.

In combat, you can challenge one creature each turn as a free action. The creature must Save. If they fail they must attack you. This ability cannot force an enemy to make major tactical errors.

### A: Champion

After all enemies have completed their turns in a combat round, select one enemy that only targeted you with attacks, and that you targeted with your attack. Make a second attack against that enemy. Effectively, this gives you two attacks per round if you are fighting an enemy one-on-one.

### B: Bodyguard

Once per round, if an adjacent ally would take damage from a physical attack, you may make an Attack roll. If you succeed, you take the damage instead.

### C: Dragon Slayer

Once per day, you may add +X damage to one of your physical attacks, where X is the HD of the most powerful monster killed by you or your party. Keep track of this. If you miss, this ability is not expended.

### C: Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d12.

### D: Aura of Courage

Allies who can see and hear you can use your Save vs Fear instead of their own. This ability has no effect if you are currently afraid.

### D: Inspire

Once per day, allies who can see and hear you heal 1d4 HP. If they were at full HP, they instead gain +2 to their next Attack roll.

### Who Are You?

You are a member of the Second Estate, an armour-clad warrior on horseback. Knights from Around Here are universally male or must appear as male. Anything goes in Foreign Parts. You lend legitimacy to any group. You may be granted titles, gifts of land, or castles. Everyone else has to work furiously to get into your social class. People respect you.

If you are from Around Here your weapon of choice is the sword and you ride a horse. In Foreign Parts, knights might use bows and ride lizards, but Foreign Parts are disreputable.

Honour and chivalry are ideals often disregarded in practice.

### The Second Estate

Your starting Noble Rank is 1. Your expenses are 12gp/month. Roll on the table below to see how you are supported.

The highest rank you can possibly inherit is 1d6+2. This might be your father’s uncle’s title or something equally remote. This might require divine intervention, a plague, or a most dreadful amount of killing. If you are a bastard, you cannot inherit unless you are legitimized by a higher noble (usually a King).

| 1d3 | Knightly Support |     | 
| :-: | :--------------- | :-- | 
| 1   | Large Farm | You hold a prosperous farm and a minor title. You have 1d6 tenants (total, not families), a small house, and no prestige. The farm pays 12gp per month. |
| 2   | Dubious Stipend | Your family is prosperous, but you are a minor son of a minor branch. Your stipend pays 12gp per month, but each month roll 1d10. On a 10 it stops forever. |
| 3   | No Support | You are a knight without land or support. There is a 50% chance you are a bastard. If you fail to pay your expenses you will drop out of the Second Estate. |

|      | Heraldry Generator  |                    |                     |
| :--: | :------------------ | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| **1d10** | **Field (Base Colour)** | **Division (Overlay)** | **Charge (Decoration)** |
| 1    | Argent (Silver) | Fess (Top/Bottom) | Escutcheon (Shield) |
| 2    | Or (Gold) | Pale (Left/Right) | Lozenge (Diamond) |
| 3    | Azure (Blue) | Bend (Diagonal S) | Roundel (Circle) |
| 4    | Gules (Red) | Bend Sinister (Diag. Z) | Billet (Vert. Rectangle) |
| 5    | Very (Green) | Saltire (Quart. X) | Mullet (Star) |
| 6    | Indigo | Cross (Quart. + | Crescent (Moon) |
| 7    | Vilette (Violet) | Chevron (Half ^) | Cross |
| 8    | Sable (Black) | Pall (Split Y) | Angel |
| 9    | Sanguine (Blood) | Wavy (Half ~) | Lion |
| 10   | Tenne (Tawny) | Dancetty (Half ^^^^^) | Sword |

Roll at least once for Field. If 1 or 2 is rolled, next result must be 3-8. Roll once for Division, designating sections as different Field colours. Roll 1d4 times for Charges, with 1d4 copies of each charge. Muck around with the idea a bit. This generator will infuriate students of heraldry. Deal with it.

To change the world, select an ability (Alter, Create, or Harm) and a number of Sorcerer Dice (SD) you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a Sorcerer, you get +1 SD per Sorcerer template. Some effects depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. Doubles, triples and quadruples result in Calamities.

SD can be used any number of times per day. Unlike a wizard’s MD, they always return to your pool. Each time you use your sorcerous powers past the first time per day, add +1 ID (Instability Die) to your pool. These dice do not count towards the [dice] and [sum] of sorcerous effects, but they do count towards doubles. Use 2 different colours of dice. Increasing the power of your sorcerous effects may also add ID.

Sorcerers don't run out of steam. They have the opposite problem.

### B: Billowing Robes

If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 10gp, your armour counts as Leather. If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 100gp, your armour counts as Chain. If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 1,000gp, your armour counts as Plate.

### C: Soul Vision

You can see the souls of living creatures. This allows you to guess the approximate location of invisible creatures. You can also immediately tell if a person is possessed, undead, protected by the Authority, or a spellcaster. The price for this gift is your connection to others. You permanently lose 1d6 Wisdom (as the constant scrutiny of souls warps your mind) or 1d6 Charisma (as you become callous and jaded).

### D: Magic Ward

Reduce all incoming magic damage by 2. This does not apply to self-inflicted damage. Once per day, negate a spell that targets you. This does not apply to spells generated by Calamities.

### Who Are You?

Your pride, sense of self, and sheer bloody-mindedness override reality. You brook no master or competition; there can be only one sorcerer in any given party, city, cabal, or cult. To the feudal system, you are an Outlaw. To the Church, you are an appalling spectacle, and should be put in your place (or in the ground) before you harm anyone else.You might be tempted to optimize your Sorcerous Powers, but consider... is that what a poweraddled, overconfident, and utterly self-assured sorcerer would do? Would they do the best thing or the coolest thing?

### Sorcerous Effects

**Harm**

Deal [sum]+[dice] damage to one target creature or object you can see. Creatures and magical objects can Save to negate. Flavour however you'd like: lightning bolts, beams of light, grasping hands from the underworld. It’s your soul vs. the target’s soul. Unlike your other abilities, this effect is permanent.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional target.

**Alter**

Make a declarative statement affecting one creature or object you can see. The statement is true for [dice] rounds. The statement cannot cause damage directly (use Harm), move a creature or object, or create new objects or effects (use Create). Creatures and magical objects can Save to avoid being altered.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional target.

+1 ID to affect an area the size of a wagon.

+2 ID to affect an area the size of a cottage.

+3 ID to affect an area the size of a village.

+1 ID to make the effect last for [dice] minutes.

+2 ID to make the effect last for [dice] hours.

+3 ID to make the effect last for [dice] days.

**Create**

Create something. The creature or object created exists for [dice] rounds. Without adding ID, the creature is person-sized or smaller and has 2 or fewer HD. Objects are person-sized or smaller.

Creatures created cannot deal damage. You can create objects with magical effects (flying carpets, invisibility cloaks), but created objects cannot deal magical damage (you can make a regular sword but not a +10 vorpal sword of fire) or or provide permanent effects (healing potions only heal for the duration listed, rings of permanent stat gain only work for the duration). You can make a sword that looks like a +10 vorpal sword of fire though.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional object or creature created.

+2 ID to create a creature of up to +4 HD.

+1 ID to create an object the size of a wagon.

+2 ID to create an object the size of a cottage.

+3 ID to create an object the size of a village.

+1 ID to create a magical or suf�ciently weird object.

+1 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] minutes.

+2 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] hours.

+3 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] days.

Starting Equipment: robes, holy book.

Starting Skill: Religion. Also, roll on the following table.

**A:** Literacy, Restrictions of your Order, Unarmed Strike

**B:** Flighty, Stunning Strike

**C:** Evasion, Obscure Knowledge

**D:** Improved Dodge, Pronouncement

Bonus

### A: Literacy

You can read and write exceptionally well. Your letters allow for Charisma tests at a distance. You can roll to see the intentions of an author, the delicate themes of a poem, and inconsistencies in a contract. To most people this is sorcery.

### A: Restrictions of Your Order

You can wear armour, but it takes up 2 additional Inventory Slots. You are expected to avoid the use of violence and magic, practice celibacy, and live righteously. Make up at least 2 other behavioural restrictions. In practice, do what you want, as long as you don’t get caught.

### A: Unarmed Strike

You do not start with proficiency in any weapons, even daggers.(You have -4 to Attack with a weapon until you gain proficiency by landing 8 successful hits in combat.) On a successful Attack roll you deal a maximum of 1 damage. If you gain a template in a fighter-type class, this restriction no longer applies.

### B: Flighty

If you choose to Act Defensively instead of attacking in a combat round, you count as wearing plate armour (16 Defence).

### B: Stunning Fist

If you hit a target with an attack on the first round of combat and the target wasn’t expecting it, you deal normal damage(1+Strength Bonus for a punch, 1d6+Strength Bonus for a dagger, etc.). If the target had total trust in your non-violent ways, they must also Save or be Stunned for 1 round.

### C: Evasion

You can never be pinned in a corner by difficult topics orarguments. You can always retreat to authority, throw up textual obstacles, or deploy dogma. No one can make you admit something in conversation that you did not intend to admit; any accidental disclosures are retroactively fixed, if possible.

### C: Obscure Knowledge

Once per session, you can declare something is to be true because you read it in a book. The base chance of the thing actually being true is 50%. There has to be a plausible way you could know about it from reading books (new discoveries, minordetails, and personal secrets are unlikely). You don't know whether or not it is true right away; the GM will roll when it matters. You might only be partially correct, but you will never be catastrophically wrong. If you have access to a library of 50 books, the base chance increases to 80%.

### D: Improved Dodge

Once per session, you can declare that an attack that hit you missed you instead. This won’t save you from falls or landslides, but traps will fail and spells will turn away.

### D: Pronouncement

You can speak for up to 3 hours without pause on a given topic. No tests required. Peasants, nobles, and other sensible people will hear you out politely, unless they've got something better todo. Monsters will still devour you, dragons might argue with you.

### Who Are You?

You are a member of the First Estate. You start at Religious Rank 1: Initiate. Your assigned duties determine if you are a Monk or a Nun. You answer to an Abbot or Abbess, and they answer to a Bishop or Archbishop. You don't have to be pious or devout to bea monk or a nun. You are expected to retreat from the world to a life of spiritual labour. Prayer, devotion, instruction, and solitudeare your only goals. Expectation and reality rarely meet. For some reason you have left your holy retreat, perhaps permanently, and now wander the rest of the world.

## Many Goblins

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
Many Goblins act as one character. There are a lot of them (though the exact amount seems to vary from scene to scene) and they contribute about as much as one actual character (at best). They are a bunch of goblins milling about in the back of the scene, doing goblin things, kind of half-paying attention, and mostly serving as colourful detail.

Starting Equipment: many daggers, filthy rags, fleas, ect. Roll for one random item from the Table of Proffesions.

Starting Skill: goblan.

**A:** Shared Totals

**B:** +1 Goblin Warlord

**C:** +1 Goblin Warlord, Use Thing

**D:** +1 Goblin Warlord, New Thing

Many Goblins gain +2 HP every level. If this would take them over 20 HP, they instead split into Two Many Goblins and lose half their maximum HP. One half runs away.

### A: Shared Totals

Many Goblins have a shared HP pool just like a normal character. Every point of damage causes a single goblin to die in an inconsequential background sort of way. Area of affect attacks and traps only affect them once. Single-target Save or Die effects instead cause Many Goblins to lose 1 HP. Other single-target spells usually affect all the goblins. Mutations might affect all the goblins or become a Thing they can use (see Use Thing below).

Somehow they consume the same ration as one person.

If Many Goblins are reduced to 0 HP, they become strewn about the place, wounded and moaning, miserable and unable to help anyone until healed. If they are reduced below 0 HP they all die in a suitably tragic-comic fashion. The only survivors will be the Goblin Warlords (see below).

Many Goblins have 5 inventory slots total. They can carry more things but they will inevitably lose, smash, ruin, sell, or eat all but 5 items. Weapons and armour are carried separately and do not occupy inventory slots. In order to gain any benefit from a weapon, armour set, or magic item, Many Goblins need 10 copies. Give them 10 swords and they deal sword damage, etc. They spend money collectively and irresponsibly.

If you need to determine exactly how Many Goblins are present, roll 1d12+6. This number varies encounter to encounter and even round to round. When performing basic unskilled labour, like digging a trench or carrying buckets, Many Goblins count as 10 people for the first hour, 5 people the next hour, and give up after the third hour. They occupy an area 20' square whenever possible, spreading as needed (a 5' wide 80' long line, etc.)

### B: Goblin Warlord

One goblin in the swarm has earned a name. Once per encounter, for one round, the named goblin can do something different than the other Many Goblins. They could run to warn the PCs while the rest of the Many Goblins fight something. At the end of the round, the Goblin Warlord is absorbed back into the swarm. Goblin Warlords get a name and a very short description like, "has a horned helmet" or "smells of cheese."

If the Many Goblins die, each Goblin Warlord becomes a Level 1 Goblan with no bonuses, the stats of the Many Goblans, and 2 HP. If the Goblin Warlords find some more goblins, or spend some time in an area where goblins are likely to be found, they can recombine to form a new Level 2 Many Goblans. Only 1 Goblin Warlord survives this process. You can use orphans, urchins, drunkards, wastrels, and particularly cunning feral dogs to fill out the ranks. Goblinism is contagious.

### C: Use Thing

Many Goblins can now be given magic items or special tools. They can use them once per encounter, collectively. This could be a Goblin Warlord action. The goblin with the magic wand fires it, the goblin with the serrated weasel-thrower uses it, then steps back into the crowd.

### D: New Thing

Many Goblins gain a special 6th inventory slot that contains a random item rolled on the Table of Professions. Roll the item randomly each encounter. If the Many Goblins run into another room or out of sight (one round at least) and then run back (a second round) they can reroll the item.

Starting Equipment: Dagger, Tattered cloak, 3 candles, a momento you are unwilling to part with.

Starting Skill: (1, d3) Occult,

**A:** Spirit Casting, +1 SD, +2 Spells (1d4), Tether

**B:** +1 SD, +1 Spells (1d6), Funeral Rite

**C:** +1 SD, +1 Spells (1d6)

**D:** +1 SD, +2 Spells (choice), Restless Cadaver

Bonus

### A: Spirit Casting

Exploding dice: The die has burned up and does not enter your pool of expended dice.

### A: Tether

Select a willing party member. Over the course of a day you form a spiritual tether to them binding your souls together. You can spend a day unteathering from someone wether theye are willing or not. 

When your tether takes damage and you can see them you may remove half the damage from them applying it to yourself. When you take damage if you can see your Tether you can remove half your damage recieved and apply it to them.

If your Tether dies it triggers a Calamity.

### B: Funeral Rite

Spend 10 minutes performing a funeral rite on a corpse you saw die. Invest any number of expent SD returning them to your pool on a 1-3. Mishaps and exploding dice still apply.

### D: Deadly Preminition

Once per day you can reroll a number of SD equal to the number of deathtouched templates you have. You must take the new roll.

### Who Are You?

### Spells

**Spectral Hand**
R:10' T:point D:[sum] minutes
Create a spectral floating hand that can manipulate items within range. It is intangible when you want it to be. You can have multiple hands active at once. For each die, you can increase the size of the hand and step up the damage of its unarmed attacks.

**Ice Knife**
R:50' T:creature D:0
Target takes [sum] damage. Adjacent creatures take [dice] damage.

**Levitate**
R:50' T:creature, object D:concentration
You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is[dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.

**Disguise**
R:touch T:person, object D:[dice] hours
You cloak the object in illusion, making it appear as another object of the same type. An apple could be disguised as any other type of fruit; a table could be disguised as any other type of furniture. A humanoid can be disguised as any other humanoid of comparable size. This only extends to the visual properties of the object. The maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell: 1 [dice]: human-sized, 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized, 3 [dice]: dragon- or tavern-sized, [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.

**Animate Object**
R:touch T:[sum] objects D:[sum] minutes
Targets become 1HD creatures that can move under their own power. Make Charisma tests to command them. They're about as smart as a trained dog, and can talk.

**Gaseous Form**
R:self/touch T:creature D:[sum] minutes
You become a roughly-humanoid conglomeration of spectral gas. You have [dice] of the substance's useful properties of your choice (e.g. flight, transparency, intangibility, etc.), and your unarmed attacks deal a relevant damage type, stepped up once for each die beyond the first. You are weak to anything the substance is weak to, and are always crit by those damage types.

**Blight**
R:touch T:creature, object D:0
Targets take [sum] necrotic damage, and show physical signs of aging (-[dice] STR/DEX/CON, counts as a wound). Objects are aged by [sum] days [1D]/months [2D]/years [3D]/decades [4D].

**Contact Great Spirit**
R:self T: D:1 hour
For the duration, you enter a trance and commune with a powerful spirit. You may ask it [dice] questions. It will answer them to the best of its ability (though cryptically), then require a favor. That favor will be proportionate to the implications of answering your question. You cannot cast this spell again until you have fulfilled your end of the bargain.

## The Senex

Starting Equipment: a walking stick and a piece of practical-but-showy headgear. Plus whatever you need for your Wizardly Tricks.
Starting Skill: See Well-Learned

**A:** Well-Learned, Wizardly Tricks, Unanswered Questions 

**B:** Ancient Tongues, Well-Known & Well-Travelled

**C:** Deep Insight, Magical Presence

**D:** Hidden Speech, 

### A: Well-Learned

You gain one of these skills at +5 for every Senex template you possess: Folklore, History, Poetry, Philology, Mysticism, Monstrumology, Alchemy, Mythology, Runes & Glyphs, Geopolitics, or something else of your own suggestion along these similar lines.
  
These skills do not count towards your skill limit as determind by the Swords stat.

### A: Wizardly Tricks
  
Every time you gain a template, roll 1d12 and gain that Wizardly Trick. If you roll a repeat, take your choice of the one above or below it.

### A: Unanswered Questions
  
You have a stat called Unanswered, which starts at 0. Everytime you encounter something very strange and mysterious and unknown in your adventuring, add 1 to your Unanswered stat. Note that this has to be stuff that is really weird and unexplained, not minor stuff. 

Good examples of unanswered questions include:

  1. What is through the Red Iron Door under Mount Breakspear?
  2. Who is the hooded figure we keep seeing at dusk and dawn?
  3. Why would our friend, the Duke of Ravenwood, suddenly turn on us?
  4. What happened that caused the ruined castle to the east to split in half?
  5. Where can we find the lair of the demonghast called Fatemonger?
  6. What does this mysterious serrated amulet do, and how do you use it?

Big, bad questions, ones with reaching implications and strange answers. Again, whenever you have a new question, write it down, and then add 1 to your Unanswered stat.

When you are in the presence of a great deal of knowledge—which might be a big library, another sage or scholar, some ancient wise being, or something else entirely—roll 1d6. If the result is less than or equal to your Unanswered stat, you learn the answer to one of your big questions, and then reduce your Unanswered stat by the amount rolled. This can be related to the source of knowledge you’re dealing with, or it could just be a flash of inspiration; how you piece the info together matters less than that you now know it.

It’s important to note that if you discover an answer to one of your big questions organically, just through playing the game, that doesn’t reduce your Unanswered stat. You only reduce your Unanswered stat when you specifically use your Senex ability to divine answers in this way.
  
### B: Ancient Tongues

When you encounter some bit of language that you don’t know—like a page in a book, inscription on a ring, or occult chanted phrase—there’s a 2-in-6 chance you know it. Not that you know the whole language, just that you happen to know what this particular bit of language means. 

As you gain templates in this class, the chances that you know any particular bit of language increases by 1-in-6 per template.

### B: Well-Known & Well-Travelled
  
When you get to a new place, like a great forest or big city, there’s a 4-in-6 chance you’ve been there before. If you have, the GM will tell you three things:

  1. Something nasty that you should watch out for, like corrupt guards or spider pits 
  2. Some smaller location of interest, like an inn or ruined temple
  3. Somebody you know who lived here the last time you came by. The first time you use this ability, they think well of you; the second time, they think badly of you; then it’s back to good, then bad, etc.

All this info is, importantly, reflective of whatever you knew the last time you were around; things might very well have changed since then.

Additionally, whenever you meet a stranger, there’s a 2-in-6 chance they recognize you; if that’s a 1, they’ve actually met you before, although you may not remember meeting them. That first roll (but not the 1) increases by 1-in-6 per template, too.
  
### C: Deep Insight

If you spend a minute or so watching someone, you can make 3 Swords checks. For each success you learn one of the following three things; what their next immediate course of action is, why they’re taking that particular course of action, and how you could best change their mind. Once you’ve done this, you can’t do it again until tomorrow, and you can’t do it to the same person two days in a row.

An example of this could be “the King is going to banish us from the realm,” and “he’s doing it because he’s already unpopular with his subjects, and news of war from the South would spark further unrest,” and “he fears for his own throne, but if we can protect his throne he’ll be happy to keep us around.”
  
### C: Supernatural Presence

You hold an air of knowledge and power about you that can only be achieved through great study and travel. When people see you, they know you to be a powerful entity, even if they can’t explain fully why. 

If you mention specific magic in the course of offering advice, counsel, explanations, or otherwise steering someone to a certain action or behavior, you have advantage on any check to do so. “Specific magic” in this case includes spells, charms, hexes, curses, blessings, spirits, demons, faeries, the undead, the supernatural in general, and really anything outside the purview of ordinary people. 

It doesn’t matter how you work in magic, really. It might be “you better step aside or else I’ll turn you into a toad,” but it might also be “to heal your sickness, you must walk to the river and back once every day and leave an offering to the river spirits there,” or even just “this unexplained phenomena is occurring because of a ghost.” When you mention the odd and unusual, people tend to believe you.

This probably doesn’t work on real spellcasters, as well as stuff like dragons, religious zealots, genuine supernatural beings, and certain pompous academics.

### D: Hidden Speech
  
When you succeed on the now 4-in-6 roll to use Ancient Tongues, you now have enough of that language to carry on a medium-length conversation fluently. 

Furthermore, you can now use Ancient Tongues (and thus Hidden Speech) on things that might not ordinarily qualify as languages: the call of wild animals, the whispering of trees, the crash of a thunderstorm, the clink of gold coins, the creak of an old castle, or the cry of the oppressed. 

### Wizardly Tricks
For each Senex template you take, you roll 1d12 and gain one of these; if you roll a repeat, take your choice of the option above or below it.

  1. **Flask**. You always have a small flask of alcohol on you, no matter what, and when you or a party member really need a slug, it’s always got just enough.
  2. **Voice**. You are very good at doing imitations and mimicry, to an uncanny degree.
  3. **Animal**. You’ve got a small animal with you, like a raven or a cat, that is cleverer than normal, can read whatever you can, and will sometimes do what you tell it to do.
  4. **Quill**. You’ve got a quill (or a knife, if you’d rather be etching than writing) that can write on anything—wood, stone, metal, whatever. 
  5. **Light**. You can touch a small object to make it glow like a candle; you get 1 hour of this per template per day.
  6. **Notebook**. You have a notebook on your person that never leaves your side. Literally. If someone takes it away from you, it’ll end up back on your person, somehow.
  7. **Cowl**. When you wear your practical headgear, you can choose to have it hide your face from all but dedicated scrutiny; you’ll just look like an old person, and people will quickly write you off.
  8. **Tea**. You’re just really bonkers good at making tea, and know tons about it; if you claim it’s magical, anyone and everyone will believe you.
  9. **Fire**. You can start a small fire with almost anything under almost any conditions. 
  10. **Staff**. Your walking stick will never break, and you have advantage on checks against being deprived of it (which includes stuff like Háma at the door to the Golden Hall).
  11. **Charm**. People just seem to take a shine to you when they first meet you, especially animals, children, and elders.
  12. **Mouth**. You can whistle clearly and loudly, blow ornate smoke-shapes, and tie knots with your tongue.
