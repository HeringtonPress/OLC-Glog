## How to Play

Simply, the referee describes a situation, and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to roll a 20 sided die and add a number from your character sheet to the roll to see if you succeed in your action. If the situation is easy, the result must be above 10 to succeed, if it’s normal, you have to beat 15, and if it’s hard, 20. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on.

Sometimes, the referee might tell you that the situation gives you advantage or disadvantage. Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best result. Disadvantage is the opposite.

## Creating a Character

- Choose or roll for your Kin. Your Kin will grant you a bonus, a drawback, and one stat you can reroll.
- Roll your Stats. 2d4 in order. You may reroll the Stat given by your Kin and pick the higher result.
- Your HP is equal to your Coins Stat.
- Choose or roll for your Class. Gain the first template (A) and any other items and bonuses.
- Starting characters gain +5 in any one skill of their choice, unless the class states otherwise, treat a classes skill list as suggestions. 
- All PCs also start with a blanket (1 slot), 4 rations (1 slot), and 4 torches (1 slot).

## Stats & Skills

### Core Stats

**Wands** represents your willingness to push yourself and the burden you can carry. It affects your Carrying Capacity.

**Coins** represents your health and hardiness. It affects your HP and the number of scars you can bear.

**Swords** represents your knowledge and capacity to learn. It affects the number of skills you can have.

**Cups** represents your personality and willpower. It is used to for social intereactions and affects the number of followers you can have.

### Additional Stats

**HP** (or Hit Points) is the amount of damage you can take before getting Wounded.

**Resistance** is the amount you reduce damage taken to a minimum of 1.

**Skills** can be anything (flower arrangement, rolling dices, etc). When asked to roll for an action, you can use one of your skills instead of the stat the referee tells you use if it would thematically make sense. You can have as many Skills as your Swords Stat to a minimum of 1.

## Classes

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>

## Fighter

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>

Starting Equipment: leather armour, sword, bow, 20 arrows.

Starting Skill: Roll on the following table.

**A:** Notches, +1 attack per round

**B:** Campaigner, Parry

**C:** Quick Learner, +1 attack per round

**D:** Impress, Cleave

You gain +1 HP for each Fighter template you possess.

### A: Notches

Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below. Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your character sheet.

- +1 Damage
- Expanded critical range (+1)
- Special ability (negotiat with GM, one per weapon).
Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1 damage, a critical range of (1-3), and the ability to stun an opponent for one round on a critical hit. The GM decides what counts as a kill.

### B: Campaigner

Armor occupies 2 fewer item slots in your inventory. Example: chain occupies 0 slots instead of 2.

### B: Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d

### C: Quick Learner

You can become proficient with a new weapon after 4 successful hits (instead of 8). On a critical hit, you immediately become proficient.

### D: Impress

Whenever you win a fight against challenging foes, people who don't like you make a new reaction roll with a +4 bonus. This even works on people you just defeated in combat, unless you caused them undeserved or disproportionate harm. Hirelings get a +2 to Morale or a new Save vs Fear.

### D: Cleave

Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP with an attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a target within 5’. You can only cleave an number of targets equal to your Level in a single round.

### Who Are You?

You are probably a member of the Third Estate. In Civilised Parts, you theoretically owe service to a lord. Carrying a sword is probably illegal, everything you do is taxed, and changing your station in life is almost impossible. If there’s a war on, all the usual rules stop applying. You might be a soldier from a levied army seeking an independent fortune, a mercenary with grand plans, or an unscrupulous highway robber. You’re likely to be practical, worldy-wise, and skeptical.

</details>

## Thief

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
Starting Equipment: leather armour, lockpicks, dagger.

Starting Skill: Locksmith and Pickpocket. +2

**A:** Always Prepared, Evaluate, Wall Crawler

**B:** Pick 1 Thief Trick, Roll 1 Thief Trick

**C:** Roll 2 Thief Tricks

**D:** Pick 1 Thief Trick, Roll 1 Thief Trick

You gain +1 to Stealth for each Thief template you possess.

### A: Always Prepared

In town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabelled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Inventory Slots, don’t cost more than you originally paid, and are available in town. You can put multiple items inside a large Unlabelled Package, including smaller Unlabelled Packages. You can have up to two Unlabelled Packages at a time.

### A: Evaluate

You automatically know the worth of mundane items. Unique items may require an Intelligence roll.

### A: Wall Crawler

You can climb as well without climbing gear as most people can with climbing gear. Simple climbs do not require a test. You can attempt impossible climbs.

### Tricks of the Trade

| 1d20 |     | Trick | 
| :--: | :-: | :---- | 
| 1    | Acrobat | You can move an extra 15’ per round (45’ total). You can jump 20’ instead of 10’. Treat your falls as 20’ shorter. You can easily maintain your balance on a taut rope. |
| 2    | Always Armed | Even when you have been disarmed, you still have a dagger hidden on you. |
| 3    | Backstab | Whenever you have a situational bonus to an Attack roll (surprise, elevation, etc.) attacks that hit deal an additional +1d6 damage. |
| 4    | Cat's Eyes | With a small amount of light (moonlight, candle) you can see 30’ in darkness. |
| 5    | Coward | Cover grants you an extra +1 AC. |
| 6    | Dog Whisperer | You start with a dog. Dogs you train can DEX save for stealth with advantage, communicate to you if an area is obviously dangerous, and track a week-old trail by scent without fail (barring magical concealment). |
| 7    | Delicate Tasks | Gain +4 on DEX saves to disable traps and pick locks. |
| 8    | Great Escape | Once per day, you can automatically escape from something that is restraining you and that you could plausibly escape from. This includes grapples, lynchings, pit traps, and awkward social situations, but not sealed coffins. |
| 9    | Lucky | 1/day reroll a D20. |
| 10   | Pack Rat | Gain an additional 3 item slots. |
| 11   | Quick Draw | Gain an additional 3 quick draw slots. |
| 12   | Quick Fingers | You have advantage on DEX saves to pickpocket people. You can steal things directly out of someone’s hands with a regular (no advantage) DEX save. |
| 13   | Recorder Crow | You start with a crow. It can make and play auditory recordings. It responds to Record, Stop Recording, Play, Pause, Rewind, and Fast Forward. Max storage: 1 hour. It’s very smart. |
| 14   | Second Chance | When you trigger a trap you hear a “click”. Save vs INT. Success means you did not trigger the trap and you know exactly what would have happened if you did. |
| 15   | Getaway Horse | You start with a horse. Horses you train can DEX Save for stealth with advantage, understand abstract directions, and follow a schedule to the minute.  |
| 16   | Redirect | Once per round, when an enemy attacks you, you can make a DEX Save to redirect their attack to another creature they can hit.  |
| 17   | Urchin | A street rat demands to learn. They’re a very sneaky hireling that doesn’t ask for pay. If you lose your urchin, you can recruit another wherever urchins are plentiful, but it will be difficult if you have a reputation for getting them killed. |
| 18   | Very Lucky | Requires Lucky. You may use your Lucky ability twice per day. An adjacent ally can use one of your rerolls, provided you could have plausibly assisted them. |
| 19   | Watchful | Gain +4 on rolls to Find Hidden Things. You can’t be snuck past. |
| 20   | Wizardly Initiate | By tasting an object you can determine if it is magical or not. |

### What Did You Do?

You are a member of the Third Estate or an Outlaw. You blend in with society or slide around it, seeking opportunities for wealth and status. You don’t dress like a thief. There are no guilds of thieves. If you are caught you will be maimed, hanged, or worse. Nobody cares who you are; everyone cares about your crimes, or your potential usefulness in their schemes.

## Wizard

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
Starting Equipment: spellbook, ink and quill, dagger, red robes.

Starting Skill: 

### Cantrips

1. Change the colour or texture of an object smaller than a horse for 10 minutes.
2. Create a tiny light as bright as a match on a figertip.
3. Move a light object with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to roll along the ground or turn the pages of a book.
  
**A:** Spellcasting, +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +2 Spells (d6)

**B:** +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +1 Spells (d8), Book Casting

**C:** +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +1 Spells (d10), Friendly Spell

**D:** +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +4 Spells (Choice)

### A: Spellcasting

Spells are living creatures. Spells, enchantments, ghosts, and souls are all more or less the same. A wizard's spells range in intelligence from pond scum to ferrets. A spellbook is a menagerie-prison. A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with spell-bullets. Minor spells, called cantrips, infest a wizard's soul and bind to it. It takes 1hr to move any number of spells between a spell slot in your brain and a spellbook, scroll, or wand.

To cast a spell, select a number of Magic Dice (MD) you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a Wizard, you get +1 MD per Wizard template. Most spells depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. Doubles generate Mishaps; triples generate Dooms. Casting a spell from a scroll provides +1 MD as the scroll burns.

Dice that roll 1-3 return to your casting pool and can be used again that day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your casting pool for the day. Your spells return at sunrise to last location they were imprisoned, when the octarine light of the sun touches the world and infuses Creation with an extra boost of raw magic. Your MD return if you get a good night's sleep. If you didn't sleep well, you can Save for each MD to have them return to your pool anyway.

When you gain Template A, roll 2d6s and gain the spells listed. Template B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. Template D, choose 4 spells from the list. If a duplicate spell is rollled, you may choose to keep it or reroll.

You can try to bodge together a spell-like effect appropriate to your school by pouring any number of MD into a target and hoping for the best. Effects are adjudicated by the GM, but are usually haphazard and dangerous. Mishaps and Dooms apply.

You can detect strong ambient magic if you are not distracted. To learn details about spells or magic items, roll under Intelligence.

### B: Book Casting

You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the scroll. This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates. You must declare you are casting a spell from a book before initiatives are rolled for the turn. You automatically go last in the initiative round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the round. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.

### C: Friendly Spell

Apply a mutation to your signature spell.

### Mishaps & Dooms

| 1d6 | Mishaps                                                           |
|:---:|:----------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours.                |
|  2  | Take 1d6 damage.                                                  |
|  3  | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail. |
|  4  | Lose 1 MD for 24 hours.                                           |
|  5  | Agony for 1d6 rounds.                                             |
|  6  | Cannot cast spells for 1d6 hours.                                                                  |


|     | Dooms                                        |
| --- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Lose the ability to cast spells for 1 day.   |
| 2   | Lose the ability to cast spells for 3 days.  |
| 3   | Lose the ability to cast spells permanently. |
  
### Who Are You?

You are a member of the Third Estate. Orthodox wizards are chartered, historic, and sensible wizards. Their colleges only accept male students, but in small struggling colleges, anyone with a false beard and a sack of gold will do. It’s an open and widely mocked secret. Orthodox wizards study all fields of magic, test theories, explore tombs,andfight in wars. Their red robes are famous; to many peasants, a wizard without red robes isn’t a wizard at all.

### Chartered Wizards

Some schools of magic have royal charters. They are protected by law in many kingdoms. Their pedigree is established, their students (while raucous and troublesome), are predictable, and their utility in war or in peace is undeniable. However grudgingly, they are allowed a place in the order of the world. Chartered schools also charge ruinous tuition, requiring the use of Wizard Student Loans. Graduates of these schools must pay back the school monthly in Magic items, strange spells, and ancient knowledge dragged out of dungeons and tombs.

### Spell List

1. **Lock**
  
R: 50' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 10 minutes

Non-living object closes and becomes locked. If the object is a door, chest, or similar object, it will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any creature passing through it and then trapping them. This spell works on things that aren't technically portals (lock a sword in its scabbard, etc.). Requires Str 10+[dice]x4 to open. Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a creature's ori􀀤ce. The creature gets a Save to resist, and another Save at the end of each of its turns.
  
2. **Knock**
  
R: 50' T: [dice] objects D: 0
  
Object is opened. Doors are 􀁃ung wide, locks are broken, shackles are bent open, belts come undone. Treat this as a Strength check made with Str 10 + [dice]x4. If target is an armoured creature, Save or armour falls off. If target is an unarmoured creature, Save or vomit for 1d4 rounds.
  
3. **Grease**
  
R: 50' T: object, surface D: [dice]x2 rounds
  
Can be cast directly on a creature or a 10' x 10' x [dice] surface. All creatures affected must Save vs Dex or drop held objects, or, if moving, drop prone.
  
4. **Force Field**
  
R: 10' T: plane or sphere D: concentration
  
Creates a shimmering force 􀀤eld, 10‘x10’, centered up to 10' away. Alternatively, create a sphere centered on the caster 5' in diameter (large enough for the caster and +1 person). The force 􀀤eld has [sum] HP. All attacks against it hit.
  
5. **Levitate**
  
R: 50' T: creature object D: concentration
  
You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is [dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.
  
6. **Magic Missile**

R: 200' T: creature D: 0
  
Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save. As an Orthodox Wizard, your spell is unique to you and can be any shape, colour, and pattern your describe.

7. **Feather Fall**
  
R: 10’ T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0

If you would take fall damage, you can cast this spell as a reaction to negate it. You 􀁃oat gently to the ground (possibly alarmingly late).
  
8. **Sleep**
  
R: 50' T: [sum] HD of creatures D: 10 min / permanent
  
Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap. Save negates. Non-alert, unaware targets do not get a Save. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)
  
9. **Light**
  
R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice]x2 hours
  
Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively, you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous.
  
10. **Wizard Vision**
  
R: touch T: sighted creature D: 10 min / permanent
  
If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can see through illusions. Non-magical disguises are not penetrated.

If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself. As above, except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects: (a) You can forever see invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else. (b) You can tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes.

The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 Wisdom (as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly mad) or 1d6 Charisma (as you accept the true nature of Creation and alienate yourself from your peers).

## Post Game Character Growth

**Heroism**. After a session, note one heroic thing you did. You can add 1 to a Skill that directly relates to this gesture. You can only know as many skills as your Intelligence. You can replace old skills as you get new ones.

**Scars**. Also, after a session, if you got wounded, you now have a scar. This scar makes you resistant to the specific danger that gave you the Wound (as defined by the referee). You can only have as many scars as your Constitution. You can replace old scars as you get new ones. If you somewhat mutate during you adventure, each mutation takes the place of a scar but cannot be removed.
  
## Leveling up

In your adventures you will find objects, the most precious of which are Treasures. By spending a Treasure carousing, a character can level up.

Whenever a PC levels: Increase their HP by 2 to a maximum of 20, select a class template up to a total of 4, then increase one of the Core Stats by 1.

At Level 4 a pc becomes a prominent figure of power within their region. Each class will have different options on what they can work towards after reaching level 4. These function purely as suggestions and you may do whatever you and your GM find the most engaging.

Additionally once a player has reached 4th level they have unlocked the will to stave off death. Making a Charisma saving throw, the DC equal to 10+ the amount of scars you have.

### Mastery

Beyond level 4, when you level up you gain 1 Mastery point. You also gain a Mastery point when you  bring a skill or a stat to +10. Once per day, you can spend Mastery points to change the result of a roll affecting any nearby ally or yourself at a rate of 1 point for +/-1 to the result.

## Rolling

When the referee tells you to roll one stat (Wands, when climbing a cliff for example), roll a D20, add your stat bonus, and, if the total is higher than 16, you succeed.

For easy situations, the referee might have you roll higher than 13. For hard situations, 20.

A referee should only call for a roll when both success and failure have interesting consequences. Sometimes, failure only means that it takes 10 minutes to achieve the action isntead of a few seconds. Bashing a door, for example, might take moments on a success, and 10 minutes on a failure, attracting monsters to the noise.

Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best result. Disadvantage is the opposite. It happens when you have contextual advantages or obstacle.

## Combat

Turn Order: Monsters act before you, unless you have surprised them or have a situational advantage.

Your Turn: On your turn, your character can move nearby, talk, shout, drop an object or themselves, and do any other one combat action, which can be moving further.

Attacking: To attack, roll your weapons damage die and the referee subtracts it from the target’s HP. Reducing a monster’s HP to 0 kills it.

## Dying & Healing

Every point of damage you take below 0 HP counts as a Wound. When you gain a wound, you fall unconscious and start dying. If you reach 10 wounds, you die.

When you are dying, you must roll Coins on each of your turns.

- On a roll of 1, your character dies.
- On a failure, you gain 1 Wound.
- On a success, nothing changes.
- On a roll of 20 or on result of 24 or higher, you stabilize and stop dying.

Up to two allies can roll Swords to stabilize you. Expending bandages gives advantage on that roll.

Stabilizing does not remove wounds.

**Resting**: An 8 hour rest with a bedroll or equivalent heals 1d6 to either HP or stat losses, consuming 1 ration.

Medical care heals all Wounds. Medical care requires to play another character for 1 session and for the wounded character to spend this time in a safe space with healers.

## Treasures

Each object you find has a certain value:

**trash** (worthless)

**mundane** (bag of silver coins)

**valuable** (bag of gold coins)

**treasure** (chest of gold coins)

**artifact** (hoard of gold)

When in town, you can trade items from one category for another in the same category (at the referee’s discression, just say what you are looking for). Alternatively, 4 mundane objects are worth 1 valuable, 4 valuables are worth 1 treasure, and 4 treasure are worth 1 artifact.

## Inventory

You have a number of Inventory Slots equal to double your Wands Stat. Only items carried count towards this limit. Horses, hirelings, and carts do not count. Clothing, minor non-magical jewellery, and other cosmetic items do not take up inventory slots unless they are particularly bulky such as armour.

An inventory slot can hold an object about the size and weight of a human head. large objects can take up multiple slots where as small objects can be stacked in groups of 4 with ammunition being stackable up to 10 per slot.

It takes an action to retrieve an item, unless it is in your first 3 slots.

## Between Adventures

Leveling up is just one way of gaining new powers. This is where you can convert treasures in character levels. If one of the following options allow you to roll on a table, you can roll once per treasure spent and choose the outcome you prefer.

**Spend a Treasure to carouse!**

You will attract new (non-combatant) followers, but there is a risk you end up partying a bit too hard if you fail a constitution roll. You level up!

**Spend a Treasure to build a base!**

1 Treasure can build a basic 30’30’ room, and one Valuable can be traded for 1 piece of standard furniture.

**Spend a Treasure to learn new skills!**

As long as you can find somebody who is an expert in them. Spend 1 Treasure to learn a new skill (+4) or improve a skill you already know (+2). You can do that once per skill between each adventure. Alternatively, you can spend a Treasure to learn a new attack from a creature you can train with. Ask the referee.

**Spend a Treasure to hire new hirelings!**

By default you have the choice between a specialist who can sneak and climb, or a fighter who comes equiped with armor and weapons. They have 0 hit points, 5 in all stats and are not suicidal. Each location can have more class options depending on the culture, at the referee’s disctretion. Hireling spellcasters know 1 spell. Hiring somebody costs 1 treasure, and they expect to be paid 1 treasure per adventure.

**Are you a magic user?**

Spend a Treasure to research new spells!
A Treasure spent in research allows to copy one spell from a scroll or spell book into your own spell book. Buying a spell scroll also costs 1 treasure.
A Treasure spent in research allow to create news spells by combining spells using spell word.

**Do you have access to the dead body of a beast, or other raw materials?**

Spend Treasures to craft!
Ask the referee what makes sense to do with the materials, but dont be afraid to give ideas. If a Treasure is spent crafting an object, it will be magical.

**Do you have access to a living beast?**

Spend Treasures to tame it! 1 Treasure makes the creature friendly to 1 person. 1 Treasure teaches it a one-word order.

**Do you have access to forbidden eldritch knowledge?**

Spend a Treasure to research eldritch knowledge and roll on their mutation tables. Some are even beneficial! Each Treasure gives you advantage on that roll.

**Can you talk with a devil or celestial?**

Spend a Treasure to negotiate a pact: you’ll get a gift and a quest. Each Treasure allows you to choose between more options for your gift and quest.

**Do you have a manual about constructs? or access to a real speciment?**

Spend Treasures to build one. 1 treasure equals 1 HD of construct.

**Have you captured an elemental spirit?**

Spend a Treasure to bind it to you: you’ll get the power to cast more spells, at a price. Each treasure gives you advantage when rolling the price.

**Have you access to necromantic tomes?**

You could spend treasures to become undead.
