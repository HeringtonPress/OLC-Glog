<details><summary>How To Play</summary>
<p>
  
The referee describes a situation, and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to roll a 20-faced die and add a number from your character sheet to the roll to see if you succeed in your action. If the situation is easy, the result must be above 10 to succeed, if it’s normal, you have to beat 15, and if it’s hard, 20. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on.

Sometimes, the referee might tell you that the situation gives you advantage or disadvantage. Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best result. Disadvantage is the opposite.

<details><summary>Character Creation</summary>
<p>

You have two core stats: **Fortitude** and **Willpower**. Roll 1D6+2 for each to determine their value.

You also have as many **Hit Points** as your Fortitude score.

You can have as many things in your **Inventory** as twice your Fortitude score.
You can have as many things in your **Psyche** as twice your Willpower score.

Choose a Character Class. Add the class’s starting equipment to your Inventory, its skills and spells to your Psyche and the class’ Template A abilities to your character sheet.

</p>

<details><summary>Stats</summary>
<p>

Your stats and skills cannot be higher than 10. If a stat becomes 0, you become paralyzed.

**Fortitude** represents your physical prowess. You roll it for strength and endurance-related feats.

**Willpower** represents your mind and personality. You roll it for social interactions, but also to resist spells and overwhelming emotions such as fear.
	
**Hit Points** (or HP) is the amount of damage you can take before getting Wounded.

**Armor** is the amount of damage you ignore when an attack hits you, to a minnimum of 1. You have 0 armor by default.
	
</p>
	
</details><details><summary>Skills</summary>
<p>

A **Skill** starts with a value of 5. When asked to roll for an action, you can use one of your skills instead of the stat the referee tells you to use if it would thematically make sense. Your skills are stored in your Psyche.

<details><summary>Inventory, Psyche & Beliefs</summary>
<p>

**Inventory**. You have as many slots as twice your Fortitude. Inventory slots can be filled with objects, but also get filled with the Scars and mutations you gain along the way. You gain Scars when you get Wounded and they can only be removed by magic.

Small items like potions and daggers can be stacked in your inventory in packs of 4 of the same type. It takes your turn to retrieve an item during combat unless it is in your first 3 slots.

**Psyche**. You have as many slots as twice your Willpower. Psyche slots can be filled with Skills, Spells, Followers and Beliefs, but also with emotional scars you gain along the way. You gain scars when you get Wounded.

You cannot go above your psyche slot limit, but you can always forget a Skill, a Spell, or a Belief, or send a follower back home. You can’t, however, get rid of a scar like that.

You can have as many **Beliefs** as you want, and they can be anything. You can change them and add more each time you level up. At the end of a game session, if you have taken a risk for one of your beliefs, you can increase one of your skills by 1. If a Skill reaches a score of 10 this way, you can remove one emotional scar.

<details><summary>Torches, Amunitions, and Consumables</summary>
<p>

Some items like torches have a finite use, represented by a D6. After 10 minutes of usage, roll the die. On a result of 1, the item is getting closer to depletion and the D6 becomes a D4. When you roll a 1 on the D4, you only have one use of the item left before it is depleted.

This system can be used for ammunitions too, in that case, instead of 10 minutes of usage, you roll after each battle where ammunition was used.

</p>

<details><summary>Combat</summary>
<p>

Turn Order: You act before the monsters unless they have surprised you.

Your Turn: You can move nearby, speak and do one other action, like casting a spell or attacking.

Attacking: Roll your weapon’s damage die and the referee subtracts it from the target’s HP. Reducing a monster’s HP to 0 kills it.

Resistance: The referee will tell you if the monster’s attack you. They will roll the monsters damage die and tell you the resluts. Reduce incoming damage by your Resistance score to a minnimum of 1.

<details><summary>Dying, Wounds, Scars and Healing</summary>
<p>

**Dying**: When you reach 0 Hit Points, you start dying. While you are dying, you gain a **Wound** at the end of each of your turns. If you reach 10 Wounds, you die. Each point of damage you take while dying also gives you an extra Wound.

While dying, you can spend your whole turn to attempt to stabilize. Make a hard Fortitude roll. On a success, you stop dying and have 1 HP. An ally that can reach you with an appropriate Skill or tool can spend their turn making a hard Willpower roll for the same effect. You also stop dying if you recover HP any other way.

Stabilizing does not heal your accumulated Wounds. Instead, you gain a **Scar**. You choose whether the scar will take an Inventory slot or a Psyche slot. As long as you have it, all your rolls against the danger that puts you in that situation are easy rolls.

**Healing**: A 8 hours rest heals all HP losses and consumes 1 ration for the team.

Medical care heals all Wounds. Medical care happens when you end an adventure in a safe location with healers.

<details><summary>Exploring</summary>
<p>

Time is tracked differently when you travel outdoors or in a dungeon. Dungeons are divided in rooms. Inside a dungeon, any worthwhile action like investigating a room or battling takes 10 minutes. You roll to see if your torches deplete every 10 minutes and the referee rolls for random encounters every 30 minutes. You can cross 10 safe rooms you have explored per 10 minutes, or 3 if you want to be discreet.

The world outside of a dungeon is divided in hexagons. Any worthwhile action like crossing or exploring a hex lasts 4h of the day (Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Dusk, Evening, or Night). The referee rolls for encounters each time you enter a new location, explore a location or rest.

</p>
</details>

* * *

<details><summary>Treasure</summary>
<p>

Each object you find has a certain value assigned by the referee:

- trash (worthless)
- mundane (bag of silver coins)
- valuable (bag of gold coins)
- treasure (bag of platinum coins)

When in town, you can trade items from one category for another in the same category (at the referee’s discretion, just say what you are looking for). Alternatively, 4 mundane objects are worth 1 valuable, and 4 valuables are worth 1 treasure.

</p>
</details>

* * *

<details><summary>Carousing</summary>
<p>

When you are back to town after an adventure, it is time to spend your loot. Here are a few options:
	
<details><summary>Celebrate</summary>
<p>

Get drunk and get known! For each Valuable spent in such way, you gain a hangover and a new random friend in town. This friend will do favours for you but stay in this town. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, one of your friends becomes a Follower and goes with you in your adventures, acting as a class-less character (until it levels up!). Followers take Psyche slots.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Build a Home</summary>
<p>

Spending a Valuable this way will give you 1 piece of mundane furniture. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, you also become the owner of a 30’ x 30’ structure of the shape you want.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Train a Skill</summary>
<p>

Spending a Valuable this way will let you increase one of your skills by 1. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, you can learn a new skill of your choice instead and put 5 points in it.

</p>
</details>

Some options open up when you have access to specific things:
	
<details><summary>Study a Spellbook</summary>
<p>

You need a Spellbook and a Treasure worth of materials to study magic. When you study, you choose which book you are studying, gain the knowledge contained in it and roll for one of its spells. If you already know the spell, roll again.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Craft with Materials</summary>
<p>

You need raw materials (like the skin of a monster you’ve slain) to craft and spend as much loot as you want on tools. The object you craft can be anything made mainly with the provided materials. If you used mundane tools, the result will be mundane; if you spend valuable tools, the object will be special; and if you spend the equivalent of a treasure for the tools, it will be magical. Discuss what you want with the referee.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Tame a Captured Creature</summary>
<p>

You need to have captured a feral Beast. You must spend 1 valuable for each of its Hit Dice to make it one of your followers. Each extra valuable spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

</p>
</details>
	

<details><summary>Contact a Horror from Beyond</summary>
<p>

You need to have an eldritch book or a way to contact an Horror. For each Valuable spent in this ritual, roll on the mutation table, choose one of the results and add it to your Inventory. The specific horrors listed on this website have their own mutation tables with extra potential benefits.

</p>
</details>
	

<details><summary>Make a Pact with a Celestial Being</summary>
<p>

You need to have a holy book or a way to contact a Divine Creature. For each Valuable spent in this ritual, roll on the Celestial Pact table in the divine creature’s description, then choose among the quests and rewards your rolled. You become bound to both and lose your soul if you fail the quest.

</p>
</details>
	

<details><summary>Build a Construct</summary>
<p>

You must have an instruction manual. Each Construct has specific instructions in their description, but it always requires magic and a lot of Treasures. On a success, you gain a very powerful follower. It is expected the party pools their resources together to craft a construct.

</p>
</details>
	

<details><summary>Bind an Elemental</summary>
<p>

You need to have the core of an Elemental Spirit and spend a Treasure in arcane materials. Roll on the binding table in the elemental’s description. You also gain a Spell Dice.

</p>
</details>

</p>
</details>

* * *

<details><summary>Leveling Up</summary>
<p>

You level up when you spend the equivalent of a Treasure in any of the carousing activities mentioned above. When you level up:

- Increase your HP by 2 (up to 20 total).
- Increase one of your stats by 1 (up to 10).
- Gain the next template of your class or take the first template of another class (up to 4 templates total).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Spell Casting</summary>
<p>

Some classes can cast spells. They have Spell Dice (SD).

**Casting a Spell**
Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to Catastrophe.

**Catastrophe**
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 Doom Point. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. They will end your wizardly career if you don’t quest to avoid your doom.

**Sigil**
Some spells mention a Sigil. It’s your unique symbol. A spell cast with a Sigil takes 10 minutes to cast, but lasts forever. You can have as many Sigils up as you have templates of a spellcasting class.
