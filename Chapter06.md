**Perk**: If someone makes a bargain with you and breaks it, Save. If you
pass, you instantly know they have broken the bargain. Your
spells can target parasites and unborn children without targeting
their hosts.

**Drawback**: You cannot bathe. You cannot return another person’s love.

**Cantrips**
1. Transform into an oily formless creature with your face that has either a) a fly speed of 2x Movement, b) 3x Movement, c) a swim speed of 2x Movement, d) a burrow speed of Movement, e) the ability to squeeze through gaps smaller than a human
head.
2. Dim or extinguish all non-magical light sources in a 20’ radius.
3. Touch someone to learn if they have killed another sentient creature in the last 24hrs.

### Spell List
 
<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>

**1.Powerful Presence**
 
R: 0 T: self D: [dice] hours

You seem to grow in magnificence and poise, and gains +2x[dice] bonus to Save vs Domination, Charm, or Fear effects. Easily frightened creatures (horses, mice, guilt-ridden murderers) must test Morale or flee.

**2.Telekinetic Shove**
 
R: 50‘ T: creature or object D: 0

An object or creature within range is hurled through the air. Save negates. A human-sized creature travels 10’ per [dice], and takes 1d6 damage for every 10' travelled. A creature thrown at another creature requires an Attack roll to hit and inflicts 1d6 damage for every 10' travelled. This spell will also blow open all the closed but unlocked doors in a room, shatter all the windows in a building, or knock the thatched roof off a peasant's shack.

**3.Shrivel**
 
R. 50' T: [dice] creatures D: 1d6 rounds / permanent

Target loses half of its current HP and loses 6 Strength (affecting the damage it deals). Save negates. When the spell ends, the lost HP and Strength return. If this spell is cast this spell with 3 or more [dice] against a single target, the lost HP does not return, and the Strength damage is permanent. The apparent age of the target increases considerably for the spell's duration.

**4.Charm Person**
 
R: 50' T: person D: [dice] hours

Target person regards the caster as a good friend and ignores the obvious spell you just cast on them. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.

**5.Control Water**
 
R: 50’ T: a bucket’s worth of water D: concentration

Control a bucket’s worth of water. At one [die]: (a) propel a small boat, (b) carry a small item through the water, (c) allow someone to swim at 2x speed, (d) force someone to swim at half speed, (e) splash something no more than 5' away, (f) dry something that is wet. Each [dice] you invest increases the effects. At 4 [dice], sink ships or move small lakes.

**6.Sleep**
 
R: 50' T: [sum] HD of creatures D: 10 min / permanent

Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap. Save negates. Non-alert, unaware targets do not get a Save. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)

**7.Dream Eater**
 
R: 50‘ T: creature D: 0

A sleeping creature within 50' takes [sum] damage. The caster heals for the same amount. No Save. When you gain this spell, if you don't know sleep already, you learn it the next time you would roll to gain a spell. It replaces one of the spells you'd roll for.

**8.Scorching Ray**
 
R: 100' T: creatures or objects D: 0

Fire a ray at a target, dealing 1d10 fire damage with a successful attack roll. Each [dice] you invest in this spell allow you to fire an additional ray at the same target or at a new target. Creatures are not set on fire, but very flammable objects such as candles, dry straw, or paper will catch fire 1 round after being struck. Instead of using this spell to deal damage, you can instead use it to light all the candles in a single room.

**9.Scry**
 
R: [dice]x100' T: point in space D: concentration

You conjure an invisible, intangible, floating eyeball to a point in space that you designate. Unlike most spells, you do not have to have line of sight to cast it. As long as you maintain concentration, you can see through this sensor with your normal senses. This spell requires something to scry on, usually a mirror, quiet pool, clouds, or bonfire. If you invest 2 or more [dice], you can also hear through the sensor (it grows an ear). If you invest at 3 or more [dice], you can also speak through the sensor (it grows a dribbly little mouth). If you use an actual crystal ball when casting this spell, the range is instead [dice] miles. Crystal balls are rare enough that they are never offered for sale, but are worth upwards of 3,000gp. Most are ancestral relics.

**10.Alter Self**
 
R: 0 T: self D: [dice]x10 minutes

Alter your form to resemble that of another creature of your type (usually humanoid). You do not gain any special abilities from this transformation.

**11.Doom**
 
R: 50' T: creature D: concentration

Target feels cold. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, and you loudly pronounce doom on them for the next 2 turns (without being interrupted or breaking line of sight), target dies on the 3rd turn. You need to truly hate the target for this spell to work, or convince yourself that you hate the target. Even a sliver of pity cancels the spell.

**12.Curse**
 
R: 50' T: mortal creature D: permanent

You inflict a Minor or Major curse on the target. Save negates. For a minor curse, you must invest 2 [dice]. For a major curse, you must invest 4 [dice]. Dice used to cast this spell are automatically exhausted. You cannot dispel your own curses but you must set a thematically appropriate cure or method of breaking it.

### Who Are You?

Animist Wizards are also known as witches. These are the bad wizards, the ones who live in shacks on the edge of town or castles on the edge of reality. They are the cursed ones, robed in black, who you seek when all other hopes fail. When the Church turns its back on you, when you scream curses into the night, when your very soul burns, then you are in need of an Animist Wizard... or ready to become one.

**Starting Equpment:** spellbook, ink and quill, 2 black thumb rings, and 3 random potions of the same type.

**Perk** When you drink a potion, you have a 50% chance to recycle it via whatever orifice you prefer. You have 10 minutes to excrete the potion ending the effect early.
 
**Drawback** Whenever you receive magical healing (except for the regeneration spell), Save. If you fail, gain a random mutation.
 
**Cantrips**
 
1. Transfer a blemish or cosmetic feature from one creature to another. E.g. swap eye colours, warts from a toad to a princess. You cannot transfer major features (poison, wings, etc.)

2. Taste blood to tell what kind of creature it came from.

3. If you wish, your appearance will no longer age. This may fail in times of dire stress.

**2.Alter Self**
 
R: 0 T: self D: [dice]x10 minutes
 
Alter your form to resemble that of another creature of your type (usually humanoid). You do not gain any special abilities from this transformation.

**3.Animate Potion**
 
R: touch T: potion or liquid D: [sum] hours
 
You turn a potion into an obedient homunculus (HD 0). It is tiny (1' tall) and feeble (Str 1), but it can go where you direct and even bring you small items (like a single coin). The potion can be delivered by touch or by “drinking” the homunculus. Aware targets can swat the homunculus away to avoid the potion's effects. Works on any liquid except water.

**4.Extract Venom**

R: touch T: creature D: 0
 
Touch a creature or object to draw all the venom out, which then pools in your hand or a vial. Unwilling venomous creatures can Save to negate. If you use this to remove the poison from a poisoned creature, that creature gets a new Save with a +4 bonus.

**5.Shrivel**

R. 50' T: [dice] creatures D: 1d6 rounds / permanent
 
Target loses half of its current HP and loses 6 Strength (affecting the damage it deals). Save negates. When the spell ends, the lost HP and Strength return. If this spell is cast this spell with 3 or more [dice] against a single target, the lost HP does not return, and the Strength damage is permanent. The apparent age of the target increases considerably for the spell's duration.

**6.Hand of the Hound**

R. self T: one or both hands D: 10 minutes

Your hand falls off and grows into a monstrous version of itself.

HD: [dice]

Attack: [dice]+d10

Resistance: 3
 
Inventroy Slots: 16
 
You continue to control it, but if it dies, you don't have a hand anymore. Alternatively, you can have this affect both hands, but you’ll look quite foolish.

**7.Infantilize**

R: touch T: creature of [dice]x2 HD or less D: [sum] minutes
 
Target Saves or becomes an adorable, if slightly eerie, child version of itself. Creatures lose 1 HD (-6 max HP, -1 to hit, -1 to Save). The target's Strength is reduced by 5. The target is now so adorable that all who see it must Save the first time they try to harm it or hesitate. If they fail this Save, they can act normally the next round.

**8.Monsterize**
 
R: touch T: creature with 0 HD (vermin) D: [sum] minutes

Target vermin (rat, scorpion, termite, etc) becomes huge and aggressive.

HD: [dice]x2

Attack: [dice]+d10

Resistance: 1

Inventory Slots: 14

Monstrified vermin attack the nearest foe, and casters usually throw the vermin as they cast this spell. Works on goblins and other low HD monsters. There is a 1-in-10 chance that this spell will be permanent. If you invest 4 [dice], the creature also mutates.

**9.Regeneration**

R: touch T: creature D: [dice] hours
 
Target regenerates 1 HP every 10 minutes. If a sufficiently magical object (a troll heart, a unicorn horn, an aboleth eye, etc.) is used in the casting, target also regrows missing limbs or damaged organs.

**10.Become Delicious**

R: 50’ T: creature of [dice]x4 HD or less D: [sum] varies
 
Target creature smells and tastes delicious for the spell's duration. The smell radiates 20' in calm air, but can spread via wind or leave a trail. Sentient creatures can usually resist the urge to eat the target without a Save, but animals and other ravenous creatures must Save or select the spell's target as their primary attack target. Insects will be attracted to the target for the spell's duration. The target may Save at the end of each duration interval to negate the effects. 1 [dice]: minutes, 2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: months, 4 [dice] years. This spell can also affect dead creatures

**11.Wave of Mutilation**

R: 30' T: area D: 0
 
Everything in a 30' cone takes [sum] slashing damage. This spell leaves dozens of deep cuts. It shreds clothing, paper, and other fragile items.
 
**12.Mutate**

R: touch T: creature D: permanent
 
Target gains [dice] random mutations. Save negates, Save once per mutation. If the creature chooses to fail its Save, roll double the number of mutations, and the caster chooses which half are gained.
 
### Who Are You?

Biomancy is forbidden. The Authority’s law is clear; mortals were meant to live for a time, age, and die. Flesh is temptation and corruption. Biomancers revel in the 􀁃esh, seeking power and immortality by adjusting their physical forms. Some masquerade as physicians, philosophers, or wizards of other schools.
