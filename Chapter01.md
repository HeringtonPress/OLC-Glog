# Base Rules

OSR DnD rules compiled and adapted from Arnold K’s Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLoG).

## How to Play

Simply, the referee describes a situation, and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to roll a D20 and add a number from your character sheet to the result. If the total is 16 or above, your character succeeds what they intended to do. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on.

## Creating a Character

- Choose or roll for your Kin. Your Kin will grant you a bonus, a drawback, and one stat you can reroll.
- Roll your Stats. 2d4 in order. You may reroll the Stat given by your Kin and pick the higher result.
- Your HP is equal to your Coins Stat.
- Choose or roll for your Class. Gain the first template (A) and any other items and bonuses.
- All PCs also start with a blanket (1 slot), 4 rations (1 slot), and 4 torches (1 slot).

## Leveling up

In your adventures you will find objects, the most precious of which are Treasures. By spending a Treasure carousing, a character can level up.

Whenever a PC levels: Increase their HP by 2 to a maximum of 20, select a class template up to a total of 4, then increase one of the Core Stats by 1.

At Level 4 a pc becomes a prominent figure of power within their region. Each class will have different options on what they can work towards after reaching level 4. These function purely as suggestions and you may do whatever you and your GM find the most engaging.

Additionally once a player has reached 4th level they have unlocked the will to stave off death. Making a Charisma saving throw, the DC equal to 10+ the amount of scars you have.

### Mastery

Beyond level 4, when you level up you gain 1 Mastery point. You also gain a Mastery point when you  bring a skill or a stat to +10. Once per day, you can spend Mastery points to change the result of a roll affecting any nearby ally or yourself at a rate of 1 point for +/-1 to the result.

## Stats & Skills

### Core Stats

**Wands** represents your willingness to push yourself and the burden you can carry. It affects your Carrying Capacity.

**Coins** represents your health and hardiness. It affects your HP and the number of scars you can bear.

**Swords** represents your knowledge and capacity to learn. It affects the number of skills you can have.

**Cups** represents your personality and willpower. It is used to for social intereactions and affects the number of followers you can have.

### Additional Stats

**HP** (or Hit Points) is the amount of damage you can take before getting Wounded.

**Resistance** is the amount you reduce damage taken to a minimum of 1.

**Skills** can be anything (flower arrangement, rolling dices, etc). When asked to roll for an action, you can use one of your skills instead of the stat the referee tells you use if it would thematically make sense. You can have as many Skills as your Swords Stat to a minimum of 1.

## Rolling

When the referee tells you to roll one stat (Wands, when climbing a cliff for example), roll a D20, add your stat bonus, and, if the total is higher than 13, you succeed.

For easy situations, the referee might have you roll higher than 10. For hard situations, 18.

A referee should only call for a roll when both success and failure have interesting consequences. Sometimes, failure only means that it takes 10 minutes to achieve the action isntead of a few seconds. Bashing a door, for example, might take moments on a success, and 10 minutes on a failure, attracting monsters to the noise.

Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best result. Disadvantage is the opposite. It happens when you have contextual advantages or obstacle.

## Combat

Turn Order: Monsters act before you, unless you have surprised them.

Your Turn: On your turn, your character can move nearby, talk, shout, drop an object or themselves, and do any other one combat action, which can be moving further.

Attacking: To attack, roll your weapons damage die and the referee subtracts it from the target’s HP. Reducing a monster’s HP to 0 kills it.

## Dying & Healing

Every point of damage you take below 0 HP counts as a Wound. When you gain a wound, you fall unconscious and start dying. If you reach 10 wounds, you die.

When you are dying, you must roll Coins on each of your turns.

- On a roll of 1, your character dies.
- On a failure, you gain 1 Wound.
- On a success, nothing changes.
- On a roll of 20 or on result of 24 or higher, you stabilize and stop dying.

Up to two allies can roll Swords to stabilize you. Expending bandages gives advantage on that roll.

Stabilizing does not remove wounds.

**Resting**: An 8 hour rest with a bedroll or equivalent heals 1d6 to either HP or stat losses, consuming 1 ration.

Medical care heals all Wounds. Medical care requires to play another character for 1 session and for the wounded character to spend this time in a safe space with healers.

## Inventory

You have a number of Inventory Slots equal to double your Wands Stat. Only items carried count towards this limit. Horses, hirelings, and carts do not count. Clothing, minor non-magical jewellery, and other cosmetic items do not take up inventory slots unless they are particularly bulky such as armour.

An inventory slot can hold an object about the size and weight of a human head. large objects can take up multiple slots where as small objects can be stacked in groups of 4 with ammunition being stackable up to 10 per slot.

It takes an action to retrieve an item, unless it is in your first 3 slots.

## Equipment

### Durability

Under certain circumstances you may be required to make a durability roll. Roll a d6 and compare it to the durability stat of the target item. if it is above the stat the item breaks.

### Melee Weapons

### Armour

Armour pieces have a resistance rating that reduce damage to a minnimum of 1. You have 4 armour slots; Head, Torso, Arms, and Legs. You can only have one piece of armour equiped to a slot at a time.

When an attack against you rolls max damage on a die you must make a durability roll. Player puts up the armour as wager on what will be destroyed.

| Item      | Effect                                | Durability | Worth    | Slots |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |:----------:|:--------:|:-----:|
| Helmet    |                                       |     2      | Mundane  |   1   |
| Chest     |                                       |     4      | Valuable |   2   |
| Gauntlets |                                       |     2      | Mundane  |   1   |
| Boots     |                                       |     2      | Mundane  |   1   |

**Shields** Like most armour shields reduce damage taken by 1 but do not take up any armour slot. They do, however, require a free hand to use. Additionally a shield can be Sundered: Breaking the shield but reducing the incoming damage by a d12 instead of 1 to a minnimum of 0. Takes up 1 slot and is of Mundane worth.
