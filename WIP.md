  ### Primary Stats

  Roll 4d4 for each of the 6 stats plus an additional roll. You may swap any two rolls with the extra roll being the amount of pennies you start with.

  Characters have 6 stats. Each stat has a “bonus”, which is a sort
  of shorthand condensation of a stat. Don’t add the bonus to rolls.

  **Strength**: Roll under Strength to open doors, tear apart chains,
  or climb a cliff. The number of items a character can carry is
  determined by their Strength score. The damage a character
  inflicts in melee combat is modifled by their Strength bonus.

  **Dexterity**: Roll under Dexterity to dodge traps, leap over
  obstacles, or perform delicate tasks under pressure. A
  character's Defense, Movement, and Stealth are modifled by
  their dexterity bonus.

  **Constitution**: Roll under Constitution to resist cold, disease,
  fatigue, drowning, and poison. A character’s Hit Points are based
  on their Constitution.

  **Intelligence**: Roll under Intelligence to solve difflcult puzzles,
  read obscure texts, or identify items and treasure.

  **Wisdom**: Roll under Wisdom to see through lies, spot hidden
  dangers, and avoid mind-altering spells. Characters will also use
  Wisdom to determine the order of combat.

  **Charisma**: Roll under Charisma to flatter, beguile, or barter. A
  character’s Save is modifled by their Charisma bonus.

  | STAT  | Bonus |
  |:-----:|:-----:|
  |  1-3  |  -3   |
  |  4-5  |  -2   |
  |  6-8  |  -1   |
  | 9-12  |   0   |
  | 13-15 |  +1   |
  | 16-17 |  +2   |
  |  18+  |  +3   |

  ### Secondary Stats

  **Hit Points**: The danger a character can resist before taking injury is
  quantified by Hit Points (HP). PCs have a maximum HP of 20. Any damage in excess of this (i.e. negative HP)
  is known as Lethal Damage, which always incurs a roll on the
  Death and Dismemberment Table.

  **Defense**: 10 + Dex bonus or bonus from armour. Leather is +2,
  Chain is +4, Plate is +6, a shield is +1.

  **Movement**: 12 + Dex. Bonus. How fast a character can move.
  Penalized by armour (-0 for leather, -2 for Chain, -4 for Plate).

  **Save**: 5 + Cha. Bonus. Increases with level. If an effect, attack,
  or challenge doesn’t fall under any of the other stats or values,
  roll Save. This represents a character’s luck and determination
  to resist the cruel hand of fate.

  ### Languages
  Every adventurer knows Common and 1+INT additional languages to a minnimum of 0.
  Additional Languages can be learned with sufficient study and a proper teacher.

  **Common**: Magically understood by all.

  **Dwarrin**: Indecipherable even by magic.

  **Draconic**: Warms speaker and burns paper.

  **Elvish**: Silent unless seen, only truthful.

  **Gloomspeak**: Can only be heard in darkness.

  **Gnomish**: Understood by plants & beast.

  **Goblin**: Putrid, lingers on the air for days.

  ### Templates and Multiclassing

  Each class has 4 Templates. Templates are gained sequentially
  (A, then B, then C, then D). To multiclass, simply pick the lowest
  template from another class. E.g. A level 4 character could pick
  Fighter A, Wizard A, Monk A, and Fighter B.

  Unless otherwise stated by the GM a PC can have no more then 4 templates.

## core rules

  ### The Core Mechanic
  Almost everything is based on rolling a d20. If you roll equal to or
  under a target number, you succeed. Roll over, and you fail.

  Throughout the text, whenever you see “Roll under...”, it means
  “Roll equal to or under...” It’s just a pain to write that out every
  single time.

  ### Opposed Rolls
  A character or NPC must roll equal to or under their stat,
  modified by 10-[the relevant stat of their opponent].

  E.g. Shoving. The PC has 11 Strength, the orc has 14 Strength.
  The PC needs to roll a 7 or less to succeed (11 + [10-14] ).

  Chess. The PC has a Intelligence of 6, the goblin has an
  Intelligence of 4. The PC needs to roll a 12 or less to succeed.

  Racing. The PC has a Movement of 12, the gladiator has a
  Movement of 14. The PC must roll under 8 to thoroughly beat
  the gladiator in a race.

  ### Healing
  1. Lunch heals a character for 1d6+Level HP. Lunch takes 1
  hour, requires a safe place, and consumes 1 ration.

  2. A Good Night’s Rest. Restores all HP. Requires 8 hours of
  rest, a safe place, a fire or heat source, and consumes 1 ration.

  3. Magical Healing. Some spells or potions restore HP. Others
  can heal Injuries.

  If a character has negative HP (i.e. has taken Lethal Damage),
  the next Lunch or Good Night’s Rest heals them to 0 and not
  over 0.

## character progression

  ### Levelling Up
  PCs gain experience points (XP) by looting stuff. Wages don’t count. The loot must be taken to a place of safety and divided or
  assigned to the PCs to become XP. Items or equipment used by the characters and not sold don’t count for XP purposes. Players
  should track a PC’s XP (the total amount of treasure they have accumulated) along with their current cash. Purely frivolous
  spending converts 10% of the money spent into XP.

  Whenever a PC levels, increase their HP, Attack, and base Save (before their Charisma bonus is added). A PC can also test to
  improve a stat of their choice. Declare the stat and roll 3d6. If the result is over, the stat’s value increases by 1.
  
  | Level | EXP  |   HP   | Templates | Save |
  |:-----:|:----:|:------:|:---------:|:----:|
  |   1   |  -   | Con-4  |     1     |  6   |
  |   2   | 200  | Con-2  |     2     |  7   |
  |   3   | 400  |  Con   |     3     |  7   |
  |   4   | 700  | Con+2  |     4     |  7   |
  |   5   | 1000 | Con+4  |     -     |  8   |
  |   6   | 1400 | Con+6  |     -     |  8   |
  |   7   | 1800 | Con+7  |     -     |  8   |
  |   8   | 2200 | Con+8  |     -     |  9   |
  |   9   | 2600 | Con+9  |     -     |  9   |
  |  10   | 3000 | Con+10 |     -     |  10  |
  |  +1   | +500 |   +1   |     -     |  10  |


## combat
  Switch to combat rounds when it looks like someone might get
  hurt.

  If someone (or a group) attacks by surprise, they get to act
  before any Initiatives are rolled for the round. Once all
  ambushers have acted, everyone rolls for Initiative.

  ### Initiative
  Each round of combat, a PC must roll under their Wisdom. If
  they succeed, they act before their enemies. If they fail, they act
  afterwards.

  ### On Their Turn
  A PC or enemy can do one of the following:

  • Make an Attack roll against a target.

  • Run about 50’+Movement (or 60’).

  • Make a charge attack against a target (Move 20’+Movement and then make an Attack roll).

  • Cast a spell or activate a magic item.

  • Retrieve an item from a non-quickdraw slot.

  • Reload a crossbow, etc.

  • Try to trip, shove, or push a target.

  • Attempt to remove a Fatal Wound from a dying ally.

  In addition, a PC or enemy can move 20’+Movement (or 30’).
  Talking, shouting, or dropping an item can be done freely, and
  possibly even in other peoples’ turns. Basically, you can do one
  big thing a turn, plus move a bit.
  
  ### Attack and Defense Rolls
  
  When a PC makes an attack against an enemy the PC must roll under the enemies defense.
  If it is a melee attack the enemies defense is modified by the PC's Str. Ranged attacks use Wis.
  
  When an enemy is attacking a PC the PC will attempt to roll under their defense score, which may be modified by the enemy.
  
  ### Damage
  • Light weapons (daggers) deal 1d6 + Strength bonus damage.

  • Medium weapons (swords) deal 1d8 + Strength bonus damage if wielded in one hand or 1d10 + Strength bonus damage if wielded in both hands.

  • Heavy weapons (hammers) deal 1d12 + Strength bonus damage but must be wielded in both hands.

  • Thrown light weapons deal 1d6 damage.

  • Bows and Slings deal 1d6 damage.

  • Crossbows deal 1d12 damage.

  ### Weapon Proficiency
  All classes are proficient with daggers. A PC is also proficient with any weapons they gain from a class or background. A PC
  has -4 to Attack with a weapon until they gain proficiency by landing 8 successful hits in combat.
